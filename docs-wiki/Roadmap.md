The Microsoft FinOps toolkit is an open-source collection of tools and resources that help you learn, adopt, and implement FinOps capabilities in the Microsoft Cloud. This document outlines the key themes and directional initiatives identified by the [[Governing board]] based on direct feedback and inputs from the [[Advisory council]] on behalf of toolkit contributors and consumers. As of May 2024, the FinOps toolkit will target publishing new releases at the end of every month, which includes updates to this roadmap and the [changelog](https://aka.ms/ftk/changes).

📅 Roadmap term: **January - December 2024**

This roadmap is a culmination of feedback from toolkit contributors, consumers, and the FinOps community as a whole. The roadmap provides a high-level view of where the toolkit is directionally headed by summarizing key themes and initiatives but is not a complete list of every change that can or will be made. We share the roadmap to garner early feedback. Ultimately, contributions are driven by the FinOps toolkit community.

While our community is growing, we don't have dedicated staff and cannot commit to explicit dates. As a result, not all items will be completed within the year. If you would like to see something added, please [create an issue](https://aka.ms/ftk/idea) or [start a discussion](https://aka.ms/ftk/discuss). And of course, we welcome any contribution via pull request.

## 🎯 Key themes for 2024

2023 was focused on establishing a baseline for a few of the core tools included in the toolkit. As we look forward to 2024, the [[Governing board]] has identified the following high-level themes:

- **End-to-end FinOps**<br>
  Expand the FinOps toolkit to encapsulate everything organizations need to learn and implement FinOps through Microsoft products, solutions, and services.<br>&nbsp;
- **Solidify the foundation**<br>
  Flesh out the infrastructure needed to scale open-source contributions and unblock key design principles of tools and resources within the toolkit, like DevOps automation and extensibility to streamline the contributor and release workflows and native support for optional or custom functionality.<br>&nbsp;
- **Enable the community**<br>
  Expand and evolve the help and support resources and options available for the broader community of contributors and consumers.<br>&nbsp;
- **Community-driven evolution**<br>
  Continuously integrate community insights and feedback to refine and enhance tools and resources to evolve in alignment with user needs and industry trends.
