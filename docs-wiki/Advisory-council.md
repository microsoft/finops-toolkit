The Microsoft FinOps toolkit advisory council represents contributors, their contributions, and end consumers for each of the tools and resources included in the FinOps toolkit. The advisory council advocates for diverse perspectives and fosters a collaborative environment, bridging the gap between the governing board and the contributors and consumers. Advisory council members are typically technical leads of one or more tools and resources that have been contributed to the FinOps toolkit.

Each seat can be filled by one and only one representative to ensure the council remains fair, balanced, and does not grow too large to be effective. The one exception is FinOps Certified Professionals who we believe have earned the right to contribute independently given their investment in certification and dedication to the FinOps space.

Individuals must meet the following criteria in order to attain a council seat:

1. Must align to a vacant seat on the council (listed above).
2. Must have detailed knowledge about the tool or resource to support consulting, technical support, or customer conversations, if needed.
3. Must engage with the community at least once per week, including customer calls.

5. Must participate in council meetings and discussions (synchronously or asynchronously).

7. Should be a FinOps Certified Practitioner.
8. Must attain a supermajority (two-thirds) board vote with no objections.

## üìë Meetings

The advisory council does not have dedicated meetings at this time. The advisory council is expected to participate (synchronously or asynchronously) in weekly FinOps toolkit sync calls on Wednesdays at 3 PM UTC or FinOps hubs sync calls on Mondays at 3:30 PM UTC. Meetings will be recorded to support asynchronous collaboration for those not able to join. Contributors and active community members may request to join these calls or view recordings as desired.

The advisory council is also invited to the monthly governing board meetings; however, attendance is optional.
