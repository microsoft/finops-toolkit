The Microsoft FinOps toolkit advisory council represents contributors, their contributions, and end consumers for each of the tools and resources included in the FinOps toolkit. The advisory council advocates for diverse perspectives and fosters a collaborative environment, bridging the gap between the governing board and the contributors and consumers. Advisory council members are typically owners of one or more tools and resources that have been contributed to the FinOps toolkit.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Composition

The advisory council consists of the following representative seats:

- Each tool and resource included in the toolkit
- Each Microsoft product family in the FinOps space:
  - Azure Advisor
  - Azure Monitor
  - Azure Resource Manager (including Management groups, Tags, Policy, Resource Graph, etc.)
  - Commerce (including Benefits, Cost Management, Pricing, etc.)
  - Microsoft Fabric (including Power BI, Data Factory, etc.)
- Each Microsoft team that provides direct, FinOps-focused support for customers:
  - Industry Solutions Division (consulting)
  - Customer Success Unit - CCX
  - Customer Success Unit - Infrastructure
  - Customer Success Unit - Data & AI
  - Azure Customer Experience - ISV & Digital Natives
  - Commerce - FastTrack
  - Developer Relations
  - Customer Support Services  
- Any FinOps Certified Professional (no limit on number)

This currently includes the following people:

| Seat                       | Member                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Azure Optimization Engine  | Helder Pinto          |
| Cost optimization workbook | Seif Bassem           |
| FinOps hubs                | Brett Wilson          |

| PowerShell module          | Anthony Romano        |
| Learning resources         | Fernando Vasconcellos |

Each seat can be filled by one and only one representative to ensure the council remains fair, balanced, and does not grow too large to be effective. The one exception is FinOps Certified Professionals who we believe have earned the right to contribute independently given their investment in certification and dedication to the FinOps space.

Individuals must meet the following criteria in order to attain a council seat:

1. Must align to a vacant seat on the council (listed above).
2. Must have detailed knowledge about the tool or resource to support consulting, technical support, or customer conversations, if needed.
3. Must engage with the community at least once per week, including customer calls.
4. Must dedicate and average of 2-4 hours per week to evolve, support, and evangelize their tool or resource.
5. Must participate in council meetings and discussions (synchronously or asynchronously).

8. Must attain a supermajority (two-thirds) board vote with no objections.
