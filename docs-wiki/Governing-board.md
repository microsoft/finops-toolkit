## üíº Responsibilities

The board is responsible for identifying short-, medium-, and long-term goals and to organizing the project to best achieve them by:

- **Mission**: Defining and upholding toolkit goals and principles.
- **Vision**: Managing the direction and solutions included in the toolkit, including:
  - Defining objectives and key results (including quality and supportability).
  - Outlining a [[high-level roadmap|Roadmap]] with key focus areas and opportunities to expand.
- **Strategy**: Defining how we'll implement the vision, including:
  - Defining board roles and responsibilities.
  - Managing the GitHub community (e.g., triaging issues, answering discussions, reviewing PRs).
  - Establishing an official support process.
  - Managing and supporting contributors and engaging with new contributions.
  - Identifying and prioritizing initiatives.
- **Performance**: Driving and quantifying value for consumers and contributors, including:
  - External communications about releases (to drive adoption/engagement).
  - Internal communications about customer impact (to justify contributors' time).
  - Telemetry to measure satisfaction, engagement, adoption, retention, etc.
- **Compliance**: Ensuring we're in compliance with Microsoft policies and procedures.

Board members are also expected to facilitate [[Support escalations]] by:

- Reviewing new and unresolved issues and discussions at least once per week.
- Responding to Microsoft Support escalations within 2 business days.
- Responding to security investigations within 1 business day.

Board members are expected to loop in appropriate [[Advisory council]] members and key contributors as needed to facilitate resolving the issue in accordance with the [[support process|Support escalations]]. Board members are not expected to resolve issues directly unless they have deep technical knowledge about the solution.

## ü§î Making decisions

The board follows a [consensus decision-making process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making#Objectives), which means:

1. **Collaborative**: Members work together to produce a shared proposal that meets the concerns of all group members as much as possible through constructive contributions.
2. **Cooperative**: Members strive to reach the best possible decision for the contributors, contributions, and consumers alike, rather than competing for personal preferences.
3. **Egalitarian**: All members have an equal opportunity to present and amend proposals.
4. **Inclusive**: As many board and council members as possible should be involved in the decision-making process.
5. **Participatory**: Members actively solicit the input and participation of all advisory council members and any additional, underrepresented stakeholders.

Decisions are generally made via "lazy approval", where consent is assumed unless valid objections are raised within 3-7 days. Decisions are approved when the board attains a supermajority (two-thirds) consensus and no objections. Any board or council member can request a 1-week extension of the deadline or to request an explicit vote across all board and council members.

Objections must have a clear justification, impact statement, and suggestions to make the proposal acceptable. If an objection is not actionable, it can be dismissed with a supermajority vote.

In general, board decisions should be open and transparent for any contributor or consumer upon request and documented in the repository. Any FinOps toolkit contributor or consumer can make an objection. The advisory council is responsible for ensuring concerns and objections from others are raised, but only council members' objections are binding.

If consensus cannot be reached within 14 days and the board believes the issue is deadlocked and unable to proceed, the board chair may decide the final resolution.
