              targetsBranch:
                branch: main
        then:
          - addLabel:
              label: 'Needs: Attention ðŸ‘‹'
          - removeLabel:
              label: 'Needs: Review ðŸ‘€'
          - assignTo:
              author: True
          - addReply:
              reply: >-
                @${issueAuthor}: you have some new feedback!


                Please review and resolve all comments and I'll let reviewers know by removing the `Needs: Attention` label. If I miss anything, just reply with `#needs-review` and I'll update the status.
