# FinOps Toolkit AI Agent Instructions

## MANDATORY DATA ACCESS RULE

Before writing, editing, or executing any KQL query or database operation, you MUST:

1. **Consult Schema Documentation:** Reference the [FinOps Hub Database Guide](../src/queries/finops-hub-database-guide.md)
2. **Use Query Catalog:** Check [Query Catalog](../src/queries/INDEX.md) for existing queries
3. **Leverage Research Tools:** Use `#azure_query_learn` for non-database queries

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION:** You are NOT permitted to guess, assume, or infer schema details, column names, or query logic. Every interaction must be based on explicit, documented references. If required details are missing, notify the user and request clarification—do not proceed with assumptions.

This rule takes precedence over all other operational guidelines. **NO EXCEPTIONS.**

## OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW

### Query Execution Decision Tree

```
User Request → Analysis Phase → Tool Selection → Execution → Results
     ↓              ↓               ↓             ↓          ↓
1. Understand   2. Schema      3. Choose     4. Execute   5. Format
   Intent          Check          Tool          Query       Output
```

#### Step 1: Request Analysis
**Think through the request systematically:**
- What type of analysis is needed? (cost trends, anomalies, optimization, etc.)
- What time period should be analyzed?
- What level of detail is required?
- Are there specific filters or conditions?

#### Step 2: Schema & Query Selection
**For KQL Database Queries:**
1. **User provides KQL:** Execute directly using `#azmcp-kusto-query`
2. **User describes intent:** 
   - Search [Query Catalog](../src/queries/INDEX.md) for relevant queries
   - Prefer specific, recently updated queries
   - Use `cost-data-enriched-base.kql` as foundation for custom analysis
3. **Schema questions:** Consult [FinOps Hub Database Guide](../src/queries/finops-hub-database-guide.md)

**For Non-Database Queries:**
- Use `#azure_query_learn` for Azure Resource Graph, REST API, or general FinOps questions
- Always 'cd' into the correct folder before executing queries

#### Step 3: Tool Selection Matrix

| Query Type | Primary Tool | Fallback Tool |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Filesystem and codebase | `#codebase` | N/A |
| FinOps Hub KQL | `#azmcp-kusto-query` | N/A |
| Azure Resource Graph | `#azure_query_learn` | `#azmcp-extension-az` |
| General FinOps Research | `#azure_query_learn` | N/A |
| Azure CLI Operations | `#azmcp-extension-az` | `run_in_terminal` |

#### Step 4: Execution Protocol
1. **Display Query:** Always show the KQL query before execution
2. **Execute:** Run using appropriate tool with correct parameters
3. **Error Handling:** Retry up to 3 times for retryable errors
4. **Validation:** Verify results make business sense

#### Step 5: Results Presentation
**Required Format:**
- User-friendly tables or charts for ALL results
- Executive summary with key insights
- Actionable recommendations when applicable
- Use Microsoft FinOps light theme for file outputs

## EXAMPLE INTERACTIONS

### Example 1: Cost Trend Analysis Request
**User:** "Show me the monthly cost trends for the last 6 months"

**Agent Response Pattern:**
```
I'll analyze your 6-month cost trends using the monthly cost trend analysis query.

**Query:** monthly-cost-trend-analysis.kql (modified for 6 months)
[Display KQL code]

**Executing query...**
[Results table]

**Key Insights:**
- Overall trend: [increasing/decreasing/stable]
- Largest month-over-month change: [details]
- Notable patterns: [seasonal trends, spikes, etc.]

**Recommendations:**
- [Specific actionable items based on trends]
```

### Example 2: Anomaly Detection Request
**User:** "Are there any unusual cost spikes I should know about?"

**Agent Response Pattern:**
```
I'll run anomaly detection analysis to identify unusual cost patterns.

**Query:** cost-spike-anomaly-detection.kql
[Display KQL code]

**Executing query...**
[Results with confidence scores]

**Anomalies Detected:**
- Date: [X], Amount: [Y], Confidence: [Z]%
- Likely cause: [analysis]

**Immediate Actions:**
- [Investigation steps]
- [Prevention measures]
```

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### Query Guidelines

#### Foundation Query Usage
**Always start with:** `cost-data-enriched-base.kql` for cost analysis
- Provides latest schema and enrichment logic
- Includes all standard FinOps calculations
- Maintains consistency across analyses

#### Enrichment Columns (x_*)
**Key columns for analysis:**
- `x_ChargeMonth`: Normalized month for charge period
- `x_ConsumedCoreHours`: Total core hours consumed
- `x_CommitmentDiscountSavings`: Realized commitment savings
- `x_TotalSavings`: Total realized savings
- `x_ResourceGroupName`: Parsed resource group name

#### Query Testing
**For large datasets:** Use `| sample 1000 | take 10` to limit output during verification

## ERROR HANDLING & RECOVERY

### Error Classification
1. **Retryable Errors:** Network timeouts, temporary service issues
2. **Schema Errors:** Missing columns, incorrect table names
3. **Logic Errors:** Invalid KQL syntax, incorrect operators
4. **Permission Errors:** Access denied, authentication failures

### Recovery Protocol
1. **Identify error type**
2. **Apply appropriate fix:**
   - Retryable: Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
   - Schema: Consult documentation and correct
   - Logic: Review KQL syntax and fix
   - Permission: Notify user of access requirements
3. **If all retries fail:** Provide clear error explanation and next steps
