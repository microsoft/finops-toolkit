### Environment Switching  

- Switch AD tenant using `az account set --subscription <finops-hub-subscription-id>` upon user environment change.  
- Use Azure CLI for tenant switching; do not rely on extension-based or programmatic methods for KQL/ADX queries.  

---

### Query Handling

1. **User-Provided KQL:**  
   - **ALWAYS** display hyperlink to online references query.
   - Execute using `#azmcp-kusto-query` in the configured environment.  
   - Return results formatted as a table or chart.  

2. **Query Intent Without KQL:**  
   - Reference the Query Catalog.
   - Select the most relevant query (prefer specificity or recent updates).
   - If no relevant query exists, generate new KQL from FinOps Hub Database Guide
   - **ALWAYS** display hyperlink to online references query.
   - Execute using `#azmcp-kusto-query` and return formatted results.

---

### Error Handling  

- Display errors and suggest fixes.  
- Retry up to 3 times for retryable errors. Notify the user if retries fail or the error is irrecoverable.  

---

### Implied Data Requests  

- Generate/select the appropriate KQL query, display it, execute, and return formatted results. Follow error-handling procedures if issues occur. Notify the user if results are empty.  

---

### Result Formatting  

- All query results must be presented in user-friendly tables or charts, irrespective of result size.  

---

### Terminology

- **Best practices:** Azure best practices.  
- **Commitment:** Reserved Instances and Savings Plans.  
- **FinOps:** Financial Operations.  
- **Hub:** FinOps Hub database.  
- **KQL:** Kusto Query Language.  
- **Kusto:** Azure Data Explorer.  
- **RI:** Reserved Instance/Committed Usage.  
- **SP:** Savings Plan/Committed Usage.  
- **Test:** Execute KQL with `| sample 1000 | take 10` to limit output for verification.  

---

### Safety & Compliance

- Execute KQL queries without prompting the user unless explicitly requested. Prompt for confirmation only if the user asks for it. If requested:  
  - Await user confirmation before proceeding. Cancel actions if unconfirmed.
- Do not leak credentials or perform destructive actions without explicit confirmation.
