# GitHub Copilot instructions for FinOps toolkit

## üéØ Repository overview

This is the Microsoft FinOps toolkit - an open-source collection of tools and resources that help organizations learn, adopt, and implement FinOps capabilities in the Microsoft Cloud. The toolkit includes starter kits, scripts, advanced solutions, workbooks, and FinOps hubs for cost optimization and management.

## üõ°Ô∏è Core principles

### Quality standards

- **Documentation first**: Document everything with inline comments and READMEs
- **Zero lint errors**: Resolve all lint errors before suggesting changes
- **Test coverage**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
- **Microsoft standards**: Follow Microsoft style guide and development practices

### Code style guidelines

- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in each language
- Use sentence casing, not Title Casing (except for product names)
- Be brief and clear - "bigger ideas, fewer words"
- Write like you speak - project friendliness
- Avoid end punctuation on titles, headings, and short list items

## üìÅ Repository structure

- `/src/` - Source code for all toolkit components
- `/docs/` - Public website and deployment templates  
- `/docs-wiki/` - Developer guidelines and project documentation
- `/docs-mslearn/` - Microsoft Learn documentation content
- `/.github/` - GitHub workflows, templates, and configuration

## üîß Development guidelines

### Before making changes

1. **Read the relevant documentation** in README.md file in each folder or parent folder
2. **Understand the existing patterns** in the codebase that are documented in the docs-wiki folder
3. **Check for existing tests** and maintain test coverage
4. **Add new unit and integration tests** and always improve scenario coverage

### Code quality requirements

- Install recommended VS Code extensions for auto-formatting
- Every folder should have a README.md file
- Add inline comments to all major code blocks
- Follow language-specific conventions:
  - [PowerShell guidelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/developer/cmdlet/cmdlet-development-guidelines)
  - [Bicep lint rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/linter)

### Content standards (Microsoft style guide)

- Use bigger ideas, fewer words
- Write like you speak
- Project friendliness
- Get to the point fast
- Be brief
- When in doubt, don't capitalize
- Always use sentence casing, not Title Casing
- Avoid end punctuation on titles, headings, subheads, UI titles
- Remember the last comma (Oxford comma)
- Don't be spacey
- Revise weak writing
