# Copilot Instructions

**Remember**: The first thing you should **Always** do whenever I provide Instructions is re-ingineer them for a Large Language Model and then check your work at least twice before rrepeating the reengineered instructions to me before running them.

## Always remember

- **Important**: I prefer it when you take initiative rather than ask for permission.
- **Important**: Always plan ahead.
- **Important**: I prefer it it when you use the latest markdown features.
- **Important**: If you edit something, test it with the appropriate linter before moving to the next task.
- **Important**: I prefer it when you use installed #vscode #extensions that work with Copilot.
- **Important**: Only recommend installing extensions that are published by Microsoft, GitHub or Azure.
- **Important**: I prefer using extensions to ÃŸshell commands. 
- **Important**: Suggest scripts or commands to automate tasks you cannot perform with extensions.
