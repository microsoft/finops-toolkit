The Azure governance workbook enables you to easily identify and track Azure resources deployed into your environment. This page details the tabs and information you'll find within the workbook.

<blockquote class="tip" markdown="1">
  _Azure Resource Graph queries are limited to 10,000 results. If you receive an error for too many rows, try selecting a smaller management group or reducing the number of subscriptions._
</blockquote>

<br>

## ℹ️ Overview

The **overview** tab provides general information about your environment, including:

- Number of resources
- Resource count by subscription (top 10)
- Resource Number by type (top 10)
- Resource count by Azure region

<br>

## 🖥️ Virtual machine

The **Virtual machine** tab is focused on Compute resources to get more information about the resource count and configuration:

- Virtual machine count by OS type
- Virtual machines by type/size (e.g., D2ms, D2v3)
- Virtual machine scale set capacity and size
- Compute disks (OS & data disk attached, OS & data disk size, OS disk SKU)
- Compute networking (NIC, private IP, public IP attached)
- Managed disk utilization
- Compute optimization
  - Underused assets (identified by Azure Advisor)
  - Orphaned disks
  - Orphaned NICs
  - Current VM status (Creating, Starting, Running, Stopping, Stopped, Deallocating, Deallocated)

<br>

## 📊 Usage + limits

Many Azure services have quotas, which are the assigned number of resources for your Azure subscription. Each quota represents a specific countable resource, such as the number of virtual machines you can create, the number of storage accounts you can use concurrently, the number of networking resources you can consume, or the number of API calls to a particular service you can make.

The **Usage & limits** tab shows resource this information about your subscriptions. To learn more about quotas, see [Quotas overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quotas/quotas-overview).

## 🎚️ Governance

Microsoft Defender for Cloud continuously assesses your hybrid and multi-cloud workloads and provides you with recommendations to harden your assets and enhance your security posture.

Central security teams often experience challenges when driving the personnel within their organizations to implement recommendations. The organizations' security posture can suffer as a result.

We're introducing a brand-new, built-in governance experience to set ownership and expected remediation timeframes to resolve recommendations.

Pre-requisite: To use this governance report, you need to create security governance rules.

To learn more, refer to [Driving your organization to remediate security issues with recommendation governance in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/defender-for-cloud/governance-rules).
