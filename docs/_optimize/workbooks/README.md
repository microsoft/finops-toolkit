FinOps workbooks are Azure Monitor workbooks that provide a series of tools to help engineers perform targeted FinOps capabilities, modeled after the Well-Architected Framework guidance.

This template includes the following workbooks:

- [Optimization](./optimization/README.md)
- [Governance](./governance/README.md)

<br>

## ‚ûï Deploy the workbooks

1. Confirm you have the following least-privileged roles to deploy and use the workbook:

   - **Workbook Contributor** allows you to deploy the workbook.
   - **Reader** view all of the workbook tabs.

   <blockquote class="tip" markdown="1">
     _If you only have read access, you can still import your workbook directly into Azure Monitor. You will not be able to save it, but you can view all tabs._
   </blockquote>

2. Deploy the **finops-workbooks** template. [Learn more](../../_resources/deploy.md).

   {% include deploy.html template="finops-workbooks" public="1" gov="1" china="0" %}
