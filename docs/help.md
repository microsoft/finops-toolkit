                If the source of the issue is a managed product (including data from Cost Management), create a Microsoft support request for that specific product. If you're not sure, ask in the [Q&A discussion forum](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/discussions/categories/q-a).

We try to respond to issues and discussions within two business days but there can sometimes be unanticipated delays. If you completed all of the preceding steps and the issue wasn't resolved within a week, we should set up a Teams call for you. Then you can share your screen so we can troubleshoot the issue together.
