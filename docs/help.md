            <p>
                For error messages, what product is showing the error? Does the error refer to another product? For missing or incorrect data, is the data generated in Power BI report or does it come directly from a product, like Cost Management?
            </p>
            <p>
                If the source of the issue is a managed product (including data from Cost Management), create a Microsoft support request for that specific product. If you're not sure, ask in the [Q&A discussion forum](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/discussions/categories/q-a).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you cannot identify the product, <strong>do not file a support request</strong>. Skip to the next step.

We try to respond to issues and discussions within three business days but there can sometimes be unanticipated delays. If you completed all of the preceding steps and the issue wasn't resolved within a week, join our [biweekly office hours](https://aka.ms/ftk/office-hours) to get live help from the team. If you need more hands-on support, you can request a paid, community-driven advisory session or consulting delivery during the office hours call.
