**Cloud policy and governance refers to the process of defining, implementing, and monitoring a framework of rules that guide an organization's FinOps efforts.**
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Define your governance goals and success metrics. Review and document how existing policies are updated to account for FinOps efforts. Review with all stakeholders to get buy-in and endorsement.

Establish a rollout plan that starts with audit rules and slowly (and safely) expands coverage to drive compliance without negatively impacting engineering efforts.

Implementing a policy and governance strategy enables organizations to sustainably implement FinOps at scale. Policy and governance can act as a multiplier to FinOps efforts by building them natively into day-to-day operations.

<br>

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting started

When you first start managing cost in the cloud, you use the native compliance tracking and enforcement tools.

- Review your existing FinOps processes to identify opportunities for policy to automate enforcement. Some examples:
  - [Enforce your tagging strategy](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/tutorials/govern-tags) to support different capabilities, like:
    - Organizational reporting hierarchy tags for [allocation](../understand/allocation.md).
    - Financial reporting tags for [chargeback](./invoicing-chargeback.md).
    - Environment and application tags for [workload management](../optimize/workloads.md).
    - Business and application owners for [anomalies](../understand/anomalies.md).
  - Monitor required and suggested alerting for [anomalies](../understand/anomalies.md) and [budgets](../quantify/budgeting.md).
  - Block or audit the creation of more expensive resource SKUs (for example, E-series virtual machines).
  - Implementation of cost recommendations and unused resources for [utilization and efficiency](../optimize/workloads.md).
  - Application of Azure Hybrid Benefit for [utilization and efficiency](../optimize/workloads.md).
  - Monitor [commitment discounts](../optimize/rates.md) coverage.
- Identify what policies can be automated through [Azure Policy](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/overview) and which need other tooling.
- Review and [implement built-in policies](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/governance/policy/assign-policy-portal) that align with your needs and goals.
- Start small with audit policies and expand slowly (and safely) to ensure engineering efforts aren't negatively impacted.
  - Test rules before you roll them out and consider a staged rollout where each stage has enough time to get used and garner feedback. Start small.

## üèóÔ∏è Building on the basics

At this point, you have a basic set of policies in place that are being managed across the organization. As you move beyond the basics, consider the following points:

- Formalize compliance reporting and promote within leadership conversations across stakeholders.
  - Map governance efforts to FinOps efficiencies that can be mapped back to more business value with less effort.
- Expand coverage of more scenarios.
  - Consider evaluating ways to quantify the impact of each rule in cost and/or business value.
- Integrate policy and governance into every conversation to establish a plan for how you want to automate the tracking and application of new policies.
- Consider advanced governance scenarios outside of Azure Policy. Build monitoring solutions using systems like [Power Automate](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-automate/getting-started) or [Logic Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-overview).
