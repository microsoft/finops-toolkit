## A

#### Amortization

**Amortization** breaks reservation and savings plan purchases down and allocates costs to the resources that received the benefit. Due to this, amortized costs will not show purchase costs and will not match your invoice.

<br>

## C

#### CSP or Cloud Solution Provider

"Cloud Solution Provider" (CSP) is a program that allows third-party Microsoft partners to sell Microsoft Cloud products and services to their end customers. In this, end customers receive bills directly from their partner and not Microsoft. Within the FinOps toolkit, CSP has the same level of support as [Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA)](#mca-or-microsoft-customer-agreement) accounts unless there is a limitation in Microsoft Cost Management or the underlying commerce platform.
