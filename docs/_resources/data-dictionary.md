Most of the columns in FinOps toolkit solutions originate in Cost Management or the FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS). Below is a list of all columns you can expect to see in our solutions. For simplicity, the data dictionary does not include the `x_` prefix used to denote non-FOCUS columns, so `x_AccountName` is listed under `AccountName`.

<!--
Columns to add:
- BillingAccountType
- CommitmentDiscountType - Derived. Indicates what is being committed (i.e., `Usage`, `Spend`).
- CostRunningTotal
- CostVariance
- PartnerCreditAmount
