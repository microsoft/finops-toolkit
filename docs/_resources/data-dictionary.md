Most of the columns in FinOps toolkit solutions originate in Cost Management or the FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS). Below is a list of all columns you can expect to see in our solutions. For simplicity, the data dictionary does not include the `x_` prefix used to denote "external" or non-FOCUS columns, so `x_AccountName` is listed under `AccountName`.

<!--
Columns to add:
- BillingAccountType
- CommitmentDiscountType - Derived. Indicates what is being committed (i.e., `Usage`, `Spend`).
- CostRunningTotal
- CostVariance
- PartnerCreditAmount

## #️⃣ Generating a unique ID

<blockquote class="warning" markdown="1">
  _Microsoft Cost Management introduced a change in how data is processed that updates cost and usage data in a lower-latency, more streaming fashion. This means cost and usage data is available in Cost Management ~2 hours after the resource provider submits it into the billing pipeline and budget alerts are able to be triggered significantly faster. Unfortunately, this change may have also introduced cases where data can be split across multiple rows where the only difference is the quantity and cost. Based on this, a unique ID cannot be determined as of February 2, 2024. As of the time of this writing, the issue was just identified. Investigation is underway. If you experience this in your data, please raise a support request._
</blockquote>

Use the following columns in the Cost Management FOCUS dataset to generate a unique ID:

1. BillingAccountId
2. ChargePeriodStart
3. CommitmentDiscountId
4. RegionId
5. ResourceId
6. SkuPriceId
7. SubAccountId
8. Tags
9. x_AccountOwnerId
10. x_CostCenter
11. x_InvoiceSectionId
12. x_SkuDetails
13. x_SkuMeterId
14. x_SkuOfferId
15. x_SkuPartNumber

<br>

## ⚠️ Known issues

1. Price and cost columns can be 0 when the data is not available in Cost Management. This includes but may not be limited to:
   - `ListCost`
   - `ListUnitPrice`
   - `x_ListCostInUsd`
   - `ContractedCost`
   - `ContractedUnitPrice`
   - `EffectiveCost`
   - `x_EffectiveUnitPrice`
2. Price and cost savings may be incomplete if not specified in Cost Management.
3. For the Cost Management connector, `PricingUnit` and `UsageUnit` both include the pricing block size. Exports (and FinOps hubs) separate the block size into `x_PricingBlockSize`.
4. For the Cost Management connector, `SkuPriceId` is not set due to the connector not having the data to populate the value.

<blockquote class="note" markdown="1">
    _If you notice any oddities in historical cost data obtained via Cost Management exports (including FinOps hubs), re-export cost data for the month in question before filing a support request._
