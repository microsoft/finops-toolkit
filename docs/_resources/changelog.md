## 🚚 v0.7

<sup>Released November 2024</sup>

📗 FinOps guide
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .mt-4 mb-0 }

> ✏️ Changed:
>
> 1. Added Enterprise App Patterns links resources to the architecting for the cloud section.
> 1. Update cost and unit of measuring handling in the [FOCUS conversion instructions](../_docs/focus/convert.md).

📊 Power BI reports
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .mt-4 mb-0 }

> ➕ Added:
>
> - General
>   1. Added partial support for OneLake URLs.
>      - This is not fully tested. This is based on feedback about OneLake file paths being different. Additional changes may be needed to fully support Microsoft Fabric.
>   1. Fix EffectiveCost for savings plan purchases to work around a bug in exported data.
>   1. Added KQL-based version of the [Cost summary](../_reporting/power-bi/cost-summary.md), [Data ingestion](../_reporting/power-bi/data-ingestion.md), and [Rate optimization](../_reporting/power-bi/rate-optimization.md) reports that connect to FinOps hubs with Azure Data Explorer.
>
> ✏️ Changed:
>
> - General
>   1. Consolidated the **Hub Storage URL** and **Export Storage URL** parameters into a single **Storage URL**.
>      - This means all datasets will either need to be raw exports outside of FinOps hubs or be processed through hubs. This release no longer supports some data from hubs and some from raw exports.
>      - If you have existing exports that are not running through hubs data pipelines, simply change the exports to point to the hub **msexports** container.
>      - This change was made to simplify the setup process and avoid errors in Power BI service configuration (e.g., incremental refresh).
>   2. Renamed the following columns:
>      - x_DatasetChanges is now `x_SourceChanges`
>      - x_DatasetType is now `x_SourceType`
>      - x_DatasetVersion is now `x_SourceVersion`
>      - x_AccountType is now `x_BillingAccountAgreement`
>   3. Updated supported spend estimates in the Power BI documentation.

<small>**Breaking change**</small>
{: .label .label-red .pt-0 .pl-3 .pr-3 .m-0 }

> ➕ Added:
>
> 1. Option to ingest data into an Azure Data Explorer cluster.
> 1. Set missing reservation list and contracted prices/cost columns for EA and MCA accounts (Data Explorer only).
>    - Requires the price sheet export to be configured.
> 1. Support for FOCUS 1.0r2 exports.
>    - The 1.0r2 dataset only differs in date formatting. There are no functional differences compared to 1.0.
>    - The 1.0r2 dataset is only needed when ingesting data into a system that requires date/time values to include seconds (for example, "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z" where the last "00" is seconds).
> 1. Support for private endpoints via an optional template parameter.
>    - Added private endpoints for storage account, Azure Data Explorer & Keyvault.
>    - Added managed virtual network & storage endpoint for Azure Data Factory Runtime.
>    - All data processing now happens within a virtual network.
>    - Added param to disable external access to Azure Data Lake and Azure Data Explorer.
>    - Added param to specify subnet range of virtual network - minimum size = /26
> 1. Support for storage account infrastructure encryption.
> 1. Published a [schema file](https://aka.ms/finops/hubs/settings-schema) for the hub settings.json file.
>
> ✏️ Changed:
>
> 1. Changed dataset names in the ingestion container to facilitate Azure Data Explorer ingestion.
>    <blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
>       _This change requires removing previously ingested data for the current month to avoid data duplication. You do not need to re-export historical data for storage-based Power BI reports; however, historical data DOES need to be re-exported to ingest into Azure Data Explorer._
>    </blockquote>
>    - For FOCUS cost data, use "Costs".
>    - For price sheet data, use "Prices".
>    - For reservation details, use "CommitmentDiscountUsage".
>    - For reservation recommendations, use "Recommendations".
>    - For reservation transactions, use "Transactions".
> 1. Renamed the `msexports_FileAdded` trigger to `msexports_ManifestAdded`.
>
> 🛠️ Fixed:
>
> 1. Fix EffectiveCost for savings plan purchases to work around a bug in exported data (Data Explorer only).
>    - The same fix was applied to Power BI reports for those not using Data Explorer. The underlying data has not changed however.

📒 FinOps workbooks
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .mt-4 mb-0 }

> ➕ Added:
>
> - [Optimization workbook](../_optimize/workbooks/optimization/README.md)
>   1. On the Storage tab, included the **RSVaultBackup** tag in the list of non-idle disks.
>
> 🛠️ Fixed:
>
> - [Optimization workbook](../_optimize/workbooks/optimization/README.md)
>   1. On the Commitment discounts tab, fixed RI ROWS Limited.

## 🪛 v0.5 Update 1

<sup>Released September 7, 2024</sup>

This release is a minor patch to Power BI files. These files were updated in the existing 0.5 release. We are documenting this as a new patch release for transparency.

📊 Power BI reports
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .mt-4 mb-0 }

> 🛠️ Fixed:
>
> 1. Corrected a bug where ADLS data sources could not be refreshed from the Power BI service ([#964](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/issues/964)).

<br>

## 🚚 v0.5

<sup>Released September 1, 2024</sup>

📗 FinOps guide
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .mt-4 mb-0 }

> ➕ Added:
>
> 1. Documented [how to compare FOCUS and actual/amortized data](../_docs/focus/validate.md) to learn and validate FOCUS data.

📊 Power BI reports
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .mt-4 mb-0 }

> ✏️ Changed:
>
> - General
>   1. Updated `ListCost`, `ListUnitPrice`, `ContractedCost`, and `ContractedUnitPrice` when not provided in Cost Management exports.
>      - Contracted cost/price are set to effective cost/price when not available.
>      - List cost/price are set to contracted cost/price when not available.
>      - This means savings can be calculated, but will not be complete.
>      - Refer to the DQ page for details about missing or updated data.
>   2. Added support for pointing Power BI reports to directly to Cost Management exports (without FinOps hubs).
>   3. Added new tables for Prices, ReservationDetails, ReservationRecommendations, and ReservationTransactions (works with exports only; does not work with hubs).
> - [Cost summary](../_reporting/power-bi/cost-summary.md)
>   1. Added a table to the [DQ page](../_reporting/power-bi/cost-summary.md#dq) to identify rows for which a unique ID cannot be identified.
>   2. Added a table to the [DQ page](../_reporting/power-bi/cost-summary.md#dq) to identify rows where billing currency and pricing currency are different.
> - [Rate optimization](../_reporting/power-bi/rate-optimization.md)
>   1. Commitment savings no longer filters out rows with missing list/contracted cost.
>      - Since `ListCost` and `ContractedCost` are set to a fallback value when not included in Cost Management data, we can now calculate partial savings.
>      - Calculated savings is still incomplete since we do not have accurate list/contracted cost values.
>   2. Merged shared and single reservation recommendations into a single [Reservation recommendations](../_reporting/power-bi/rate-optimization.md#reservation-recommendations) page.
>
> 🛠️ Fixed:
>
> - General
>   1. Fixed a bug in Cost Management exports where committed usage is showing as "Standard" pricing category.

🏦 FinOps hubs
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .mt-4 mb-0 }

> ➕ Added:
>
> 1. Added an optional `skipEventGridRegistration` template parameter to support skipping Event Grid RP registration.
> 2. Added an Event Grid section to the hubs create form.
>
> ✏️ Changed:
>
> 1. Changed the Event Grid location selection logic to only identify fallback regions rather than supported regions.
> 2. Expanded cost estimate documentation to call out Power BI pricing and include a link to the Pricing Calculator.
>
> 🛠️ Fixed:
>
> 1. Updated the config_ConfigureExports pipeline to handle when scopes in settings.json is not an object.
> 2. Fixed a bug where scopes added via the Add-FinOpsHubScope command are not added correctly due to missing brackets.

📒 Azure Monitor workbooks
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 .mt-4 mb-0 }

> ➕ Added:
>
> - [Optimization workbook](../_optimize/workbooks/optimization/README.md):

>   4. Updated Storage not v2 query to exclude blockBlobStorage accounts from the list
>   5. Added export option for the list of idle backups to streamline data extraction
> - [Governance workbook](../_optimize/workbooks/governance/README.md):
>   1. Removed the management group filter to simplify filtering by subscription.

> 3. Option to scope consumption exports to MCA Billing Profile.
>
> ✏️ Changed:
>
> 1. Improved SQL Database security, replacing SQL authentication by Entra ID authentication-only.
>
> 🛠️ Fixed:
>
> 1. `Premium SSD disk has been underutilized` recommendation was not showing results due to a meter name change in Cost Management ([#831](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/issues/831)).
> 2. Consumption exports for Pay-As-You-Go MCA subscriptions were missing cost data ([#828](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/issues/828))

🖥️ PowerShell
