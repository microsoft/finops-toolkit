The FinOps toolkit Power BI reports provide a great starting point for your FinOps reporting. We recommend customizing them to keep what works, edit and augment reports with your own data, and remove anything that isn't needed. You can also copy and paste visuals between reports to create your own custom reports.

FinOps toolkit reports support several ways to connect to your cost data. We generally recommend starting with Cost Management exports, which supports up to $2-5 million in monthly spend. If you experience data refresh timeouts or need to report on data across multiple directories or tenants, please use [FinOps hubs](/finops-toolkit/hubs), a data pipeline solution that optimizes data and offers additional functionality. For additional details and help choosing the right backend, see [Help me choose](/finops-toolkit/power-bi#%EF%B8%8F-help-me-choose).

Please note support for the [Cost Management connector for Power BI](https://aka.ms/costmgmt/powerbi) is available for backwards compatibility, but is not recommended. The Microsoft Cost Management team is no longer updating the Cost Management connector and instead recommends exporting data.
