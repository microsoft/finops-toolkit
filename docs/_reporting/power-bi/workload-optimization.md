The **Workload optimization report** provides insights into resource utilization and efficiency opportunities based on historical usage patterns. This report enables you to:

- Identify unattached disks.

This report pulls data from:

- Cost Management exports or FinOps hubs
- Azure Resource Graph

You can download the Workload optimization report from the [latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/releases).

<blockquote class="note" markdown="1">
_The Workload optimization report is new and still being fleshed out. We will continue to expand capabilities in each release in alignment with the [Cost optimization workbook](../../_optimize/workbooks/optimization/README.md). To request additional capabilities, please [create a feature request](https://aka.ms/ftk/ideas) in GitHub._

## Unattached disks

The **Unattached disks** page lists the unattached disks sorted by cost.

The chart shows the cost of each disk over time. The table shows the disks with related properties, including billed and effective cost and the dates the disk was available during the selected date range in the Charge period filter at the top-left of the page.
