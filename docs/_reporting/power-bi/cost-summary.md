The **Cost summary report** provides a general overview of cost and savings with a few common breakdowns that enable you to:

- Identify the top cost contributors.
- Review changes in cost over time.
- Build a chargeback report.
- Summarize cost savings from negotiated and commitment discounts.

You can download the Cost summary report from the [latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/releases/latest).

## Working with this report

This report includes the following filters on each page:

- Charge period (date range)
- Subscription and resource group
- Region
- Commitment (e.g., reservation, savings plan)
- Service (e.g., Virtual machines, SQL database)
- Currency

A few common KPIs you fill find in this report are:

- **Effective cost** shows the effective cost for the period with reservation purchases amortized across the commitment term.
- **Total savings** shows how much you're saving compared to list prices.

Note the currency must be single-select to ensure costs in different currencies aren't mixed.
