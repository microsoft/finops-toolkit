<blockquote class="note" markdown="1">
   _As of FinOps toolkit 0.2, the FOCUS report was merged into the Cost summary report. Both [Cost summary](./cost-summary.md) and [Rate optimization](./rate-optimization.md) (was Commitment discounts) reports now use FOCUS 1.0 preview. If you would like to use the FOCUS report, you can download it from the FinOps toolkit 0.1.1 release._
</blockquote>

The **FOCUS report** is an example Azure dataset that aligns to the FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS), an open specification that provides a common schema for cost and usage data. To learn more, see [focus.finops.org](https://focus.finops.org).

You can download the FOCUS report from the [FinOps toolkit 0.1.1 release](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/releases/v0.1.1).

## Working with this report

This report includes the following filters on each page:

- Date range
- Sub account (subscription)
- Service category
- Service name
- Region
- Currency

A few common KPIs you fill find in this report are:

- **Amortized cost** shows the effective cost for the period with commitment-based discount purchases amortized across the commitment term.
- **Billed cost** shows the billed cost as it would appear on your invoice.

Note the currency must be single-select to ensure costs in different currencies aren't mixed.

<br>

## Get started

The **Get started** page includes a basic introduction to the report with additional links to learn more.

<br>

## Raw data

The **Raw data** page includes a table with all FOCUS columns (except the IDs to conserve space). This page is useful to familiarize yourself with the columns themselves.

<br>

## Services

The **Services** page offers a breakdown of cost by service. Each service is grouped into a **service category**, which is similar to how service are organized on the Azure.com website.

<blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
   _The FOCUS ServiceName column is not the same thing as MeterCategory or the ServiceName column for Enterprise Agreement accounts. FOCUS ServiceName is a grouping of resources in each category. This means bandwidth charges for a VM will be grouped under the Compute service category rather than the Network meter category. This distinction is very important when comparing numbers between FOCUS and Azure schemas._

## Working draft

The **Working draft** page shows the latest developments from the FOCUS working draft, which currently includes the following changes compared to FOCUS 0.5:

- `AmortizedCost` was renamed to `EffectiveCost`.
- `ChargeFrequency` was added to indicate how often a charge will be repeated.
- `CommitmentDiscountId` and `CommitmentDiscountName` were added to indicate the commitment discount that was applied to a charge.
- `ListUnitPrice` was added to indicate the list (or retail) price for a charge.
