This template creates a new **FinOps hub** instance.

FinOps hubs include:

- Data Lake storage for data staging.
- Data Explorer to host cost data.
- Data Factory for data processing and orchestration.
- Key Vault for storing secrets.

<blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
  _To use this template, you will need to create a Cost Management export that publishes cost data to the `msexports` container in the included storage account. See [Create a new hub](README.md#-create-a-new-hub) for details._

   _<sup>1. It is sufficient to assign hubs resources deployment permissions on the resource group scope.</sup>_<br/>
   _<sup>2. Cost Management permissions must be assigned on the scope where you want to export your costs from.</sup>_<br/>
   _<sup>3. Blob data permissions are required to access exported cost data from Power BI or other client tools.</sup>_<br/>

2. The Microsoft.EventGrid resource provider must be registered in your subscription. See [Register a resource provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider) for details.

## üéõÔ∏è Resources

The following resources are created in the target resource group during deployment.

Resources use the following naming convention: `<hubName>-<purpose>-<unique-suffix>`. Names are adjusted to account for length and character restrictions. The `<unique-suffix>` is used to ensure resource names are globally unique where required.

      - Dataset-specific functions for the latest supported FOCUS version (e.g., `Costs`, `Prices`).
      - Dataset-specific functions for each supported FOCUS version (e.g., `Costs_v1_0` for FOCUS 1.0). These functions are provided for backwards compatibility. All functions return all data aligned to the targeted FOCUS version.
    - Datasets include: `Costs`, `Prices`.
    - Supported FOCUS versions include: `v1_0`.
  - `Ingestion` database ‚Äì Stores ingested data.
    - Settings:
      - `HubSettingsLog` table ‚Äì Stores a history of high-level configuration changes (e.g., versions, scopes).
      - `HubSettings` function ‚Äì Gets the latest version of the hub instance settings.
      - `HubScopes` function ‚Äì Gets the currently configured scopes for this hub instance.
    - Open data:

      - `Regions` table ‚Äì [Regions mapping file](../data/README.md#regions) from the FinOps toolkit. Used for data normalization and cleanup.
      - `ResourceTypes` table ‚Äì [ResourceTypes mapping file](../data/README.md#resource-types) from the FinOps toolkit. Used for data normalization and cleanup.
      - `Services` table ‚Äì [Services mapping file](../data/README.md#services) from the FinOps toolkit. Used for data normalization and cleanup.
    - Datasets:
      - `<dataset>_raw` table ‚Äì Raw data directly from the ingestion source. Uses a union schema for data from multiple sources.
      - `<dataset>_transform_vX_Y` function ‚Äì Normalizes and cleans raw data to align to the targeted FOCUS version using open data tables as needed.
      - `<dataset>_final_vX_Y` table ‚Äì Clean version of the corresponding raw table aligned to the targeted FOCUS version. Populated via an update policy that uses the corresponding transform function when data is ingested into raw tables.

In addition to the above, the following resources are created to automate the deployment process. The deployment scripts should be deleted automatically but please do not delete the managed identities as this may cause errors when upgrading to the next release.

- Managed identities:
  - `<storage>_blobManager` ([Storage Blob Data Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor)) ‚Äì Uploads the settings.json file.
  - `<datafactory>_triggerManager` ([Data Factory Contributor](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#data-factory-contributor)) ‚Äì Stops triggers before deployment and starts them after deployment.
- Deployment scripts (automatically deleted after a successful deployment):
  - `<datafactory>_deleteOldResources` ‚Äì Deletes unused resources from previous FinOps hubs deployments.
  - `<datafactory>_stopTriggers` ‚Äì Stops all triggers in the hub using the triggerManager identity.
  - `<datafactory>_startTriggers` ‚Äì Starts all triggers in the hub using the triggerManager identity.
  - `<storage>_uploadSettings` ‚Äì Uploads the settings.json file using the blobManager identity.
