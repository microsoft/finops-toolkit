Working session for FinOps toolkit contributors to align on changes, review proposals, unblock work, and coordinate contributions.

**This is for**: Contributors and maintainers working on code, architecture, docs, or standards.

**This is not for**: Customer support, demos, or general community discussion. For help with FinOps toolkit issues, join our [biweekly office hours](./office-hours) instead.

Come ready to collaborate, share ideas, and build together!

## Schedule

The contributor sync is held **every Wednesday** from **8:00-8:30 AM Pacific (4:00-4:30 PM UTC)**.
