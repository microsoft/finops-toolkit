    To save costs, host multiple apps in one App Service Plan if resources allow. Ensure the plan can handle the additional load to avoid performance issues. Isolate an app in a new plan if it's resource-intensive, requires independent scaling, or needs deployment in a different region. Refer to SKU limits to avoid overloading. Keep in mind that active slots also consume resources.

    Use autoscaling instead of manual instance adjustments to optimize performance and costs. Choose a rule-free autoscaling option for simplicity, or define precise rules based on thorough performance testing. Ensure enough resources are available to meet performance targets, and account for application initialization time when setting scaling rules.
