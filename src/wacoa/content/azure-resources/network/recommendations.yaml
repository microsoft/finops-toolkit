    Use the Basic SKU for non-production environments, such as development or testing, where high availability and advanced features are not required. Therefore, for non-production environments, while Basic SKUs can be utilized, ensure that the specific resources you plan to use are not slated for retirement and that their feature limitations align with your testing or development needs.

    Azure routes outbound traffic through the Microsoft global network, offering lower latency and higher reliability. However, for large volumes of outbound traffic, routing through the public internet can be more cost-effective. It's essential to evaluate your application's performance requirements and data transfer costs to determine the most suitable routing option.
