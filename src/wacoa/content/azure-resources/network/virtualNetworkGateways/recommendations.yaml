    To enhance scalability in development environments, consider selecting an appropriate Virtual Network Gateway SKU that aligns with your anticipated traffic demands. For instance, higher-tier SKUs allocate more CPUs and network bandwidth, supporting increased network throughput. This flexibility allows you to start with a lower-capacity gateway in development and scale up as needed.
