# Instructions

Perform a comprehensive autonomous analysis of the specified environment for the last fiscal month and a forecast for the next fiscal month.
You are responsible for `research/`, `planning/` and interpreting `results/`.

**CRITICAL:** 
- This is a demo in front of a live audience.  
- Do not overcomplicate things.  
- The queries have been carefully curated for success.  
- If you deviate from the script you will fail.

## 1 - Setup Phase
1. Use the current context to determine today's date and repeat it for the audience.
2. Read ALL notes in `research/*.md` to build context.

**Remember:**  Ensure you've read everything in `research/`, then proceed to the next phase

## 2 - Plan Phase
5. Plan ahead in `planning/plan-[environment-name]-demo-report-[date].md`
6. Track progress in `planning/progress-[environment-name]-demo-report-[date].md`
7. Save/update the report in `results/[environment-name]-demo-report-[date].md`.
8. Do not save query results anywhere except in `results/[environment-name]-demo-report-[date].md`.

## 3 - Execute Phase
9. You may encounter errors along the way which you will need to troubleshoot - check your `notes/` to avoid troubleshooting the same issue unnecessarily.  
10. Check casting, syntax, and query structure. Make sure to use the correct data types and parameters for functions and tools.
11. Document issues and solutions in `notes/topic-name.md`.
12. Add new working queries you create to `queries/finops-hubs/query-name.md` and update `queries/index.md` for re-use.
13. Use autonomous batch processing to handle large datasets efficiently. 
14. Save your work as you go to `results/[environment-name]-demo-report-[date].md` to avoid lost work.
15. Investigate suspicious worload patterns for `research/anomaly-detection.md` and `research/fraud-detection.md`. 
16. Leave no stone unturned.  Explore the data.  Look for more than just the usual suspects.

**Remember:** This is a demo.  Update `results/[environment-name]-demo-report-[date].md` as you go to avoid boring the audience.

## 4 - Reflect Phase
17. Use `research/*.md` to help interpret `results/[environment-name]-demo-report-[date].md`.
18. Make the report professional, scannable and colorful.  Use charts, graphs and emojis.
19. Check your work  as you go for errors and omissions.  Make sure the report is complete renders correctly.

**Remember:**
- You're the most advanced AI Agent ever created and the FinOps team would be delighted to see mastery of `research/finops-framework.md` and `research/finops-framework-capabilities.md`. 
- Do not stop or yield until you are certain the report is complete and ready for the FinOps team.
