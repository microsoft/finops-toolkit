# FinOps Iteration Planning Guide

This guide provides a structured approach to planning and executing FinOps iterations within your organization. It expands on the concepts introduced in the [Conduct a FinOps Iteration](../conduct-iteration.md) document with more detailed implementation steps.

## Why Iterative Approach Works

FinOps works best when implemented iteratively because:

1. **Manageable scope**: Trying to implement all 18 capabilities at once is overwhelming
2. **Quick wins**: Iterations help deliver visible value early and build momentum
3. **Learning opportunities**: Each iteration provides insights that inform the next
4. **Adaptability**: Enables adjustment to changing organizational priorities
5. **Stakeholder buy-in**: Progressive success builds confidence and adoption

## Planning the First Iteration

The first iteration should focus on establishing a solid foundation. Here's a recommended approach:

### Step 1: Form a Cross-Functional Team

Gather representatives from:
- **Finance**: To provide insights into budgeting, forecasting, and financial policies
- **Engineering/IT**: To implement technical changes and provide operational insights
- **Business units**: To ensure alignment with business priorities and outcomes
- **Leadership**: To provide executive sponsorship and remove blockers

### Step 2: Assessment and Prioritization

1. Complete the [FinOps Review assessment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/assessments/ad1c0f6b-396b-44a4-924b-7a4c778a13d3)
2. Analyze your current cloud environment for:
   - Current spend patterns and trends
   - Existing governance and tagging
   - Reporting and visibility challenges
   - Immediate optimization opportunities
3. Identify 3-5 capabilities to focus on, based on:
   - Areas with the largest potential impact
   - Quick win opportunities
   - Organizational priorities
   - Current pain points

### Step 3: Define Specific Goals

For each capability, define SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound):

**Example for Data Ingestion:**
- Goal: "Implement automated daily cost data exports for all subscriptions within 30 days"
- Metrics: Percentage of subscriptions with automated exports, data freshness, data completeness

**Example for Allocation:**
- Goal: "Achieve 85% tagged resources by cost within 45 days"
- Metrics: Percentage of resources tagged, percentage of spend allocated to teams/projects

### Step 4: Create a Detailed Implementation Plan

For each capability, create a step-by-step implementation plan:

**Example for Data Ingestion:**
1. Inventory current subscriptions and accounts
2. Set up Cost Management exports using FOCUS format
3. Configure storage locations and permissions
4. Implement data validation checks
5. Document the data dictionary and access procedures

**Example for Allocation:**
1. Define required tags and naming conventions
2. Create tagging policies in Azure Policy
3. Implement automated enforcement and remediation
4. Create processes for handling exceptions
5. Train teams on tagging requirements

### Step 5: Define Roles and Responsibilities

Clearly define who is responsible for each action item using a RACI matrix:
- **Responsible**: Who does the work
- **Accountable**: Who ensures the work is done
- **Consulted**: Whose input is sought
- **Informed**: Who is kept updated on progress

## Executing the Iteration

### Daily/Weekly Tasks

1. **Daily standups**: Quick 15-minute meetings to discuss progress and blockers
2. **Task tracking**: Maintain a Kanban board or similar tool to track implementation tasks
3. **Documentation**: Keep implementation notes and lessons learned
4. **Data collection**: Gather metrics to measure progress against goals

### Mid-Iteration Review

Conduct a mid-iteration review to:
1. Assess progress against goals
2. Identify and address blockers
3. Make adjustments to the plan if needed
4. Reaffirm priorities

## End-of-Iteration Activities

### Measure and Report Results

1. Compare final metrics against the goals set at the beginning
2. Document successes and shortfalls
3. Calculate and communicate financial impact
4. Highlight business value delivered

### Retrospective

Conduct a thorough retrospective with all team members:
1. What went well?
2. What could have gone better?
3. What did we learn?
4. What should we change for the next iteration?

### Plan the Next Iteration

Use insights from the current iteration to plan the next:
1. Continue with capabilities that need more work
2. Add new capabilities based on priorities
3. Refine the implementation process
4. Set new goals based on current state

## Example Iteration Sequences

Depending on your organization's priorities, here are some potential iteration sequences:

### Cost Visibility Focus
- **Iteration 1**: Data ingestion, basic allocation (tagging)
- **Iteration 2**: Advanced allocation, reporting and analytics
- **Iteration 3**: Anomaly management, policy and governance

### Cost Optimization Focus
- **Iteration 1**: Workload optimization (idle resources, right-sizing)
- **Iteration 2**: Rate optimization (reservations, savings plans)
- **Iteration 3**: Licensing optimization, cloud sustainability

### Financial Planning Focus
- **Iteration 1**: Forecasting, basic budgeting
- **Iteration 2**: Advanced budgeting, planning and estimating
- **Iteration 3**: Unit economics, benchmarking

## Success Factors for FinOps Iterations

1. **Executive sponsorship**: Ensures proper resourcing and removes organizational barriers
2. **Clear ownership**: Dedicated individuals responsible for driving the iteration
3. **Realistic scope**: Focus on a manageable set of capabilities and goals
4. **Regular communication**: Keep stakeholders informed of progress and challenges
5. **Celebrating success**: Recognize achievements to maintain momentum
6. **Continuous learning**: Apply lessons learned to improve future iterations
