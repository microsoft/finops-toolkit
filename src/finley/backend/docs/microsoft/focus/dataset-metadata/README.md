# FOCUS Dataset Metadata

This directory contains JSON metadata schema files that describe the FOCUS dataset structure. These files define the columns, data types, and descriptions for the FOCUS-formatted cost and usage data.

## Available Schemas

- [FocusCost 1.0](./FocusCost_1.0.json) - The current stable release of the FOCUS schema
- [FocusCost 1.0-preview(v1)](./FocusCost_1.0-preview\(v1\).json) - Preview version of the FOCUS schema

These schema files are used to validate FOCUS-formatted data and to provide metadata information for tools that work with FOCUS data, such as Microsoft Fabric and FinOps Hubs.

For more information about FOCUS, see [What is FOCUS?](../what-is-focus.md) or visit the [FOCUS specification](https://github.com/FinOps-Open-Cost-and-Usage-Spec/FOCUS_Spec) GitHub repository.
