# Azure Carbon Optimization

Azure Carbon Optimization provides tools and strategies to monitor and reduce the carbon footprint of your Azure workloads, aligning sustainability goals with FinOps practices.

## Key Features

1. **Microsoft Sustainability Manager**
   - Record, report, and reduce environmental impact
   - Track progress toward sustainability goals

2. **Azure Emissions Impact Dashboard**
   - Monitor carbon emissions from Azure services
   - Gain insights into the carbon impact of your cloud usage

3. **Sustainable Cloud Architectures**
   - Techniques for reducing carbon footprint through architecture choices
   - Efficient resource utilization patterns

## Integration with FinOps

Carbon optimization often aligns with cost optimization because:

1. **Reduced resource usage** lowers both costs and carbon emissions
2. **Right-sized resources** are both more cost-effective and more energy-efficient
3. **Optimized architectures** can reduce both spending and environmental impact

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor emissions**: Use the Emissions Impact Dashboard to establish baselines
2. **Optimize resource utilization**: Turn off idle resources and right-size VMs
3. **Use PaaS over IaaS** when possible for better efficiency
4. **Schedule workloads during low-carbon intensity periods** when appropriate
5. **Prioritize regions** with lower carbon intensity for deployments

## Carbon-Aware Strategies

1. **Workload shifting**: Move non-urgent workloads to times with more renewable energy
2. **Region selection**: Deploy to regions with lower carbon intensity
3. **Dynamic scaling**: Scale resources based on both demand and carbon intensity
4. **Energy-efficient coding**: Optimize applications for lower energy consumption
