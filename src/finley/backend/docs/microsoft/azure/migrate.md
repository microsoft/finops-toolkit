# Azure Migrate

Azure Migrate is a centralized hub for discovering, assessing, and migrating to Azure. From a FinOps perspective, it helps organizations plan cost-effective migrations and optimize their cloud spending from the start.

## Key Features

### Discovery and Assessment

- **Server Assessment**: Size and cost recommendations for Azure VMs
- **Database Assessment**: Sizing and cost recommendations for Azure SQL and Azure Database for MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Web App Assessment**: Suitability and cost analysis for Azure App Service migration
- **Data Estate Assessment**: Cost recommendations for migrating to Azure SQL

### Migration Tools

- **Server Migration**: Migrate physical/virtual servers to Azure VMs
- **Database Migration**: Migrate databases to Azure database services
- **Web App Migration**: Migrate web applications to Azure App Service
- **Virtual Desktop Migration**: Assess and migrate to Azure Virtual Desktop

## FinOps Benefits

Azure Migrate provides several capabilities that support FinOps practices:

1. **Right-sizing**: Get pre-migration recommendations to avoid over-provisioning
2. **Cost Estimates**: Calculate TCO for running workloads in Azure
3. **Assessment Reports**: Detailed recommendations for cost-optimized deployments
4. **Modernization Recommendations**: Identify opportunities to move from IaaS to PaaS services

## Best Practices for Cost-Effective Migration

1. **Thorough Discovery**: Ensure comprehensive discovery of on-premises resources
2. **Analyze Utilization Patterns**: Use long-term performance data for accurate sizing
3. **Consider Reserved Instances**: Factor in commitment discounts during planning
4. **Explore Application Modernization**: Identify candidates for transforming to PaaS
5. **Tag Resources During Migration**: Implement cost allocation tagging early

## Integrating Migration with FinOps Process

1. **Pre-Migration**: Use assessment tools to forecast costs and build budgets
2. **During Migration**: Tag resources according to FinOps taxonomy
3. **Post-Migration**: Monitor actual vs. projected costs and right-size as needed
