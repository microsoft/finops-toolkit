# Azure Governance

Azure Governance provides services and tools that help you manage your Azure resources at scale. It's an essential component of FinOps practices, as it helps enforce cost policies and optimize spending.

## Key Governance Services

### Azure Policy

Azure Policy helps enforce organizational standards and assess compliance at scale. With Azure Policy, you can:

- Create, assign, and manage policies to enforce rules for your resources
- Implement cost management policies (e.g., restrict expensive VM sizes)
- Ensure resources have proper cost management tags
- Prevent creation of non-compliant resources
- Apply policies in bulk to existing resources

### Azure Cost Management Policies

Examples of cost-specific policies:

- Allow only specific VM sizes
- Require cost center tags on all resources
- Enforce use of Azure Hybrid Benefit where applicable
- Prevent deployment of resources in expensive regions
- Enforce auto-shutdown schedules for development resources

### Azure Blueprints

Azure Blueprints allows packaging of Azure resources, Azure Policy, and other artifacts to create reproducible environments that comply with organizational standards, including cost policies.

### Azure Management Groups

Management groups provide a governance scope above subscriptions, allowing you to organize subscriptions into hierarchies for unified policy and access management.

## Integration with FinOps

Azure Governance supports key FinOps principles:

1. **Accountability**: Enforce tagging for cost allocation
2. **Optimization**: Prevent deployment of over-provisioned resources
3. **Forecasting**: Maintain predictable spending patterns through policy enforcement
4. **Culture**: Embed cost awareness in deployment processes

## Best Practices

1. **Start small**: Begin with a few high-impact policies
2. **Use initiatives**: Group related policies into initiatives
3. **Test policies**: Always test in non-production environments first
4. **Balance governance with agility**: Avoid overly restrictive policies that hinder innovation
5. **Review regularly**: Periodically review policies for relevance and effectiveness
