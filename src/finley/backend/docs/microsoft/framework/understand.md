# Understand Usage and Cost

This domain is focused on data acquisition, reporting, analysis, and alerting on top of your cost, usage, and carbon consumption. This domain focuses on observability and business intelligence. It involves gathering data (ingestion), organizing it for the organization (allocation), generating reports (reporting), and monitoring to proactively identify and address issues (anomalies).

## Domain Capabilities

### Data Ingestion
Data ingestion refers to the process of collecting, transforming, and organizing data from various sources into a single, easily accessible repository. With this capability, you identify data sources needed to support your FinOps practice and facilitate FinOps tasks.

Key activities include:
- Gathering cost, utilization, performance, and other business data from cloud providers, vendors, and on-premises systems
- Planning for data standardization requirements to support reporting
- Organizing data logically by categorizing or tagging it

### Allocation
Allocation is the process of attributing, assigning, and redistributing shared costs and usage by using accounts, tags, and other metadata. It helps establish accountability among teams and projects within an organization. 

Key activities include:
- Identifying critical attributes for reporting based on stakeholder needs
- Establishing a mapping of cloud costs to each attribute
- Developing an allocation plan with rules for dividing shared costs equitably

### Reporting and Analytics
Reporting and analytics involve analyzing cloud data and creating reports to understand usage and spending patterns. It helps identify opportunities for improvement and supports informed decision-making about cloud resources.

Key activities include:
- Building reports and reporting infrastructure needed to facilitate other FinOps capabilities
- Ensuring proper visibility and transparency across the organization
- Supporting monitoring and optimization at scale

### Anomaly Management
Anomaly management refers to the practice of detecting and addressing abnormal or unexpected cost and usage patterns in a timely manner. This capability is especially important with usage-based billing models, where small fluctuations in usage can result in large fiscal impact.

Key activities include:
- Identifying, triaging, and addressing unexpected changes in cost, usage, and carbon
- Setting up proactive monitoring for unusual patterns
- Establishing response protocols for anomalies
