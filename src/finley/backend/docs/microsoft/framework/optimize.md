### Workload Optimization
Workload optimization involves analyzing cost, usage, and carbon emissions for cloud workloads to identify opportunities to maximize efficiency. This usually starts with recommendations and expands into more nuanced optimization efforts.

Key activities include:
- Analyzing resource utilization patterns
- Identifying and eliminating idle resources
- Right-sizing compute resources based on actual usage
- Implementing autoscaling and scheduling

### Rate Optimization
Rate optimization is the practice of obtaining reduced rates on cloud services, often by committing to a certain level of usage or spend over a specific period.

Key activities include:
- Analyzing SKU usage patterns to inform commitment discount planning
- Committing to specific hourly usage targets to receive discounted rates
- Leveraging savings plans and reserved instances where applicable

### Licensing and SaaS
Licensing & SaaS involves managing and optimizing the financial aspects of software licensing agreements and Software as a Service (SaaS) investments within an organization.

Key activities include:
- Tracking and managing software licenses
- Ensuring prepaid SaaS products are being fully utilized
- Implementing bring-your-own-license offers like Azure Hybrid Benefit
- Optimizing license assignments based on actual usage
