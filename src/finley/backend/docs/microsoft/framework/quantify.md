# Quantify Business Value

This domain focuses on analyzing cost, usage, and carbon emissions to align with organizational plans and measure the return on investment from cloud computing efforts. This domain is all about measuring and maximizing the business value each team and workload gets from the cloud to maximize future potential.

## Domain Capabilities

### Planning and Estimating
Planning and estimating involve predicting the cost and usage of new and existing workloads based on potential architectural changes and shifting business priorities. With this capability, you establish baseline expectations for new cloud workloads and prepare for changes to existing workloads.

Key activities include:
- Developing cost models for new workloads
- Estimating the financial impact of architectural changes
- Creating baseline expectations for resource needs

### Forecasting
Forecasting involves analyzing historical trends and future plans to predict costs, understand the impact on current budgets, and influence future budgets. With this capability, you'll project future cost, usage, and carbon emissions based on historical trends.

Key activities include:
- Analyzing historical usage and cost trends
- Identifying patterns expected to change
- Reviewing forecasts against current budgets to identify risks

### Budgeting
Budgeting is the process of monitoring and managing financial plans and limits over a specific period to control spending effectively. This capability allows you to use established estimates and forecasts to allocate funds to each team for fiscal year planning and set up alerts to ensure budget accountability.

Key activities include:
- Creating financial plans based on forecasts and estimates
- Setting up budget alerts and monitoring systems
- Developing remediation plans for budget overruns

### Benchmarking
Benchmarking is a systematic process of evaluating the performance and value of cloud services using efficiency metrics, either within an organization or against industry peers. This capability allows you to measure and track key performance indicators to identify and accelerate the adoption of successful initiatives.

Key activities include:
- Establishing cloud performance metrics
- Comparing internal team performance
- Analyzing industry benchmarks when available

### Unit Economics
Unit economics focuses on understanding the relationship between business metrics and cloud costs to maximize the value derived from cloud investments. This helps in making informed decisions that align technology investments with business outcomes.

Key activities include:
- Defining business-relevant cost units
- Measuring cost per transaction or customer
- Optimizing based on business value rather than just technical metrics
