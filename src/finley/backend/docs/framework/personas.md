# FinOps Personas

Implementing FinOps requires many stakeholders, or Personas, in an organization to work collaboratively with the FinOps team. Personas represent broad stakeholder groups that must collaborate, not individual people. In a complex organization, a Persona may represent many people in various related roles, and in very small organizations, a single person may perform the duties of multiple Personas. Each has an important part to play in supporting FinOps.
