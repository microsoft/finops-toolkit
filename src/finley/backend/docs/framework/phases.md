# FinOps Phases

FinOps is performed by working iteratively on the [Framework Capabilities](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/) through three phases: **Inform**, **Optimize**, and **Operate**.

Teams within an organization may be working at different FinOps Phases at any time. Practitioners should always be looking at the organization’s cloud use, identifying ways it could be improved, and creating documentation to empower the individuals responsible for enacting changes that will drive the most value.

Quick action on a regular cadence can help teams avoid analysis paralysis and reinforce the good practice of starting small and growing the size and scope of the team’s actions as it matures through experience and momentum.

The goal is to continuously develop strategies and refine workflows that involve the activities encompassed by the Framework Capabilities, measuring the results, making incremental improvements, and maturing the process to reduce the time required to cycle through these phases.

## Phases

### Inform: Visibility & Allocation
- Identify data sources for cloud cost, usage, and efficiency data.
- Use this data for allocation, analysis, and reporting to empower teams in budgeting, forecasting, benchmarking, and developing metrics.
- Accurate allocation enables accurate reporting and business/financial teams to drive ROI while staying within budget.

#### Inform
Visibility & Allocation: In the Inform phase, FinOps activities involve identifying data sources for cloud cost, usage, and efficiency data. Using this data for allocation, analysis, and reporting empowers teams to develop capabilities in budgeting, forecasting trends, and building KPIs for benchmarking.

### Optimize: Rates & Usage
- Identify opportunities to improve cloud efficiency using data and capabilities developed in the Inform Phase.
- Build capabilities to rightsize resources, modernize architectures, manage workloads, and automate waste elimination.
- Optimize cloud rates through visibility, analysis, and reporting to empower purchase and management of discount pricing models.

#### Optimize
Rates & Usage: In the Optimize phase, FinOps activities involve identifying opportunities to improve cloud efficiency using the data and capabilities developed in the Inform Phase. This includes rightsizing underutilized cloud resources and managing workloads.

### Operate: Continuous Improvement & Usage
- Implement organizational changes to operationalize FinOps using data and capabilities from previous phases.
- Establish governance, compliance monitoring, training, guidelines, and automation policies aligned with objectives.
- Build a culture of accountability and collaboration for continuous, incremental action.

#### Operate
Continuous Improvement & Usage: In the Operate phase, FinOps activities involve implementing organizational changes to operationalize FinOps using the data and capabilities developed in the Inform and Optimize phases. This includes establishing cloud governance policies and compliance monitoring.
