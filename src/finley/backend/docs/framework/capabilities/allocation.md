# Allocation

Allocation involves defining strategies to assign and share cloud costs using accounts, tags, labels, and other metadata, creating accountability among teams and projects within an organization.

## Capability Definition

Allocation is the process of assigning cloud costs and usage to specific business units, products, teams, or other organizational structures to create visibility and accountability for cloud spend.

## Domain: Understand Usage & Cost

Allocation is a key capability within the "Understand Usage & Cost" Domain as it helps organizations understand how costs are distributed across the business.

## Why Organizations Implement This Capability

Organizations implement the Allocation capability to:

- Create accountability for cloud costs at the team or product level
- Provide visibility into how cloud resources are being used
- Support accurate chargeback or showback processes
- Enable more accurate budgeting and forecasting
- Identify areas of inefficiency or optimization opportunities
- Align cloud costs with business outcomes
- Support decision-making about resource prioritization

## How Organizations Implement This Capability

### Maturity Assessment: Crawl

In the Crawl stage, organizations typically:
- Implement basic account structures for high-level allocation
- Use simple tagging strategies for major resources
- Allocate a portion of costs (50-70%) to business units
- Have manual allocation processes for untagged resources
- Provide basic reporting on allocated costs
- Have limited or inconsistent tagging policies

### Maturity Assessment: Walk

In the Walk stage, organizations typically:
- Implement comprehensive tagging strategies
- Automate tag enforcement and compliance
- Allocate most costs (80-90%) to business units
- Implement shared cost allocation models
- Provide detailed reporting on allocated costs
- Have formal tagging policies and governance
- Implement automated tag correction or remediation

### Maturity Assessment: Run

In the Run stage, organizations typically:
- Achieve near-complete allocation (>95%) of all cloud costs
- Implement sophisticated allocation methodologies for shared services
- Automate allocation processes end-to-end
- Integrate allocation with business metrics and outcomes
- Provide real-time allocation visibility
- Have mature governance and compliance processes
- Enable self-service allocation reporting and analytics

## Input Dependencies

- Cloud provider billing and usage data
- Organization structure and cost centers
- Resource metadata and tags
- Business context (projects, applications, departments)
- Shared services and platform usage patterns
- Governance policies and requirements

## Tool Requirements

- Cloud cost management platforms
- Tag management and enforcement tools
- Custom allocation logic engines
- Business intelligence and reporting tools
- Policy enforcement mechanisms
- Integration with CMDB or asset management systems

## Real-World Implementation Examples

- A financial services company implemented a hierarchical tagging strategy that allows allocation of costs from the project level up to lines of business and corporate divisions.
- A software company created a shared service allocation model that distributes platform costs based on consumption metrics relevant to each service.
- A healthcare organization implemented a hybrid allocation model that uses direct tagging for application-specific resources and usage-based allocation for shared platform services.

## Common Challenges 

- Dealing with untagged or improperly tagged resources
- Determining appropriate allocation methodologies for shared services
- Managing the complexity of multi-tenant environments
- Handling special case resources that don't fit standard allocation models
- Ensuring consistency in tagging across cloud accounts and providers
- Balancing allocation accuracy with implementation effort
- Managing allocation changes over time as organization structures evolve
