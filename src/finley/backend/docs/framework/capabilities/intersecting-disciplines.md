# Intersecting Disciplines

Coordinating activities with interconnected disciplines or [Allied Personas](https://www.finops.org/framework/personas/#:~:text=Compliance%20and%20Governance-,Allied%20Personas,-Organizations%20may%20have) (such as ITAM, ITFM, Sustainability, Security) which manage responsibilities broader than just cloud, and which must integrate into the organizational cloud strategy by collaborating with FinOps.

## Definition

This capability supports interactions between FinOps and other IT disciplines, frameworks, or teams in an organization. Widespread cloud use creates new challenges for traditional IT disciplines. The goal is to capture FinOpsâ€™ interactions with these existing IT functions, such as IT Financial Management (ITFM), Technology Business Management (TBM), IT Asset Management (ITAM), Software Asset Management (SAM), IT Service Management (ITSM), IT Security, and others impacted by cloud consumption.

Collaboration is essential, and the central FinOps Team and partner teams must embrace the [FinOps Principle](https://www.finops.org/framework/principles/) of collaboration. Allied Personas are highlighted to underscore the need for cross-team partnership.

## Maturity Assessment
- **Crawl**: Individual understanding of assets/resources, education on intersections, Allied Personas have deep framework knowledge, education enhances mutual understanding.
- **Walk**: Shared understanding and reconciliation of assets/resources, business case evaluation, shared taxonomy, comprehensive view of costs, effective communication and analysis.
- **Run**: Common taxonomy for cost management, close alignment, tracking of savings, use of hybrid rights, operational tools/processes scaled for agility, common toolset, standardized recurring actions.

## Functional Activities
- Maintain clear communication and coordination (FinOps)
- Align tools, reports, and data sources for reliability
- Make service/license info available to Allied Personas
- Track costs and realized savings for shared optimization
- Use FinOps/Allied Persona info for design, profitability, TCO, governance (Product)
- Leverage Allied Persona info for planning, transparency, governance (Finance)
- Optimize procurement and contracts (Procurement)
- Tag resources, distribute costs, partner for TCO (Engineering)
- Direct strategy, serve as escalation, assume accountability (Leadership)
- Share license entitlements, manage renewals, promote transparency (Allied Personas)

## Measures of Success & KPIs
- Consistent reporting and coordinated policy/governance
- License compliance and optimization
- Security and risk management
- % of licenses available through migrations
- % of applications moved to cloud
- % of support costs reduced
- Tag compliance, % of costs aligned with standards
- % of unallocated/untagged cloud resources
- See [KPI Library](https://www.finops.org/wg/finops-kpis/) for more
