# Anomaly Management

Anomaly Management gives a FinOps team the ability to detect, identify, clarify, alert on, and manage unexpected cloud cost events in a timely manner, in order to minimize impact to the business.

## Capability Definition

Anomaly Management is the process of identifying, evaluating, and responding to unexpected or significant deviations in cloud costs or usage patterns that may indicate problems or opportunities.

## Domain: Understand Usage & Cost

Anomaly Management is a critical capability within the "Understand Usage & Cost" Domain as it helps organizations identify and address unexpected changes in cloud spending.

## Why Organizations Implement This Capability

Organizations implement the Anomaly Management capability to:

- Quickly identify unexpected increases in cloud costs
- Prevent budget overruns and financial surprises
- Address technical issues that may be causing excessive resource usage
- Identify potential security incidents or unauthorized usage
- Improve cost predictability and control
- Enable prompt corrective actions
- Create accountability for resource usage
- Protect against service disruptions related to quota limitations

## How Organizations Implement This Capability

### Maturity Assessment: Crawl

In the Crawl stage, organizations typically:
- Implement basic cost monitoring with simple thresholds
- Perform manual reviews of cost reports to identify anomalies
- Have basic alerting for significant cost increases
- Document manual processes for anomaly response
- Have limited ability to drill down into anomaly causes
- Focus on total cost anomalies rather than specific services
- Have reactive approaches to anomaly management

### Maturity Assessment: Walk

In the Walk stage, organizations typically:
- Implement automated anomaly detection systems
- Create defined workflows for anomaly investigation
- Set service-specific thresholds and alerts
- Establish response teams and escalation paths
- Implement root cause analysis processes
- Develop historical pattern analysis capabilities
- Create documentation of common anomaly types

### Maturity Assessment: Run

In the Run stage, organizations typically:
- Implement machine learning-based detection systems
- Create predictive anomaly models that identify issues before they become significant
- Establish automated remediation for common anomalies
- Integrate anomaly management with CI/CD and deployment processes
- Implement fine-grained, context-aware detection thresholds
- Create comprehensive response playbooks
- Establish continuous improvement processes for detection accuracy

## Input Dependencies

- Cloud provider billing and usage data
- Resource allocation and tagging information
- Historical usage patterns and trends
- Expected usage changes from deployments or business activities
- Budget and forecast information
- Application and service monitoring data
- Resource utilization metrics

## Tool Requirements

- Anomaly detection and alerting systems
- Cloud cost management platforms
- Monitoring and observability tools
- Notification and communication systems
- Investigation and root cause analysis tools
- Reporting and tracking systems
- Integration with deployment and change management systems

## Real-World Implementation Examples

- A financial services company implemented a machine learning system that analyzes historical patterns and alerts when usage deviates from expected ranges, taking into account seasonal patterns.
- A retail organization created automated workflows that immediately notify application owners when their services exceed cost thresholds, with escalation to management after 24 hours without acknowledgment.
- A technology company integrated anomaly detection with their deployment pipeline to automatically identify cost impacts of new code releases.

## Common Challenges 

- Balancing sensitivity (avoiding false positives) with timely detection
- Managing alert fatigue from too many notifications
- Determining appropriate thresholds for different services and environments
- Coordinating response across multiple teams
- Distinguishing between legitimate business growth and true anomalies
- Handling complex, distributed anomalies that span multiple services
- Accounting for seasonal or cyclical patterns in detection systems
