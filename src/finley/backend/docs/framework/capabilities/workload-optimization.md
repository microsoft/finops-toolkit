# Workload Optimization

Analyze and optimize cloud resources to match specific usage patterns while ensuring that workloads operate efficiently, sustainably, and generate sufficient business value for their cost.

## Definition

Workload Optimization ensures cloud resources are properly selected, sized, scheduled, configured, and highly utilized to meet requirements at the lowest cost and environmental impact. Engineering leads this work, collaborating with FinOps, Product, and other personas. Optimization includes waste reduction, workload management, scaling, rightsizing, temporal/georegional shifting, modernization, and continuous improvement. A workload optimization strategy sets priorities, thresholds, KPIs, and guidelines for tradeoffs. Optimization is ongoing due to evolving cloud services and business needs.

## Maturity Assessment
- **Crawl**: Basic strategy, top resource targeting, basic KPIs, visibility into utilization, focus on compute, simple efficiency metrics.
- **Walk**: Comprehensive strategy, differentiated approaches, value/impact estimation, cost/effort measurement, documented recommendations, basic automation.
- **Run**: Comprehensive strategy for many services, detailed data, automated alerting/cleanup, automated triage, tracked recommendations, impact analysis.

## Functional Activities
- Create/manage optimization strategy (FinOps)
- Collaborate with Engineering, Sustainability, Product
- Support reporting/data/analysis for optimization
- Architect/purchase services with strategy/KPIs (Engineering)
- Use elasticity, rightsizing, workload management, automation
- Review utilization/efficiency, identify improvements
- Highlight/utilize optimization opportunities (Finance)
- Guide procurement negotiations (Procurement)
- Define service KPIs, provide demand forecasts (Product)
- Deliver business value vision, support KPIs, drive prioritization (Leadership)

## Measures of Success & KPIs
- Data efficiency applied to >50% of stored data
- $/GB/mo storage rates reduced by >30% from baseline
- Use of unit economics for workload KPIs
- See [KPI Library](https://www.finops.org/wg/finops-kpis/) and [Waste Management library](https://www.finops.org/wg/identifying-shared-costs/)

## Inputs & Outputs
**Inputs:**
- Reporting & Analytics for underutilization/idle/adjustment
- Data Ingestion for performance/observability
- Objectives from Finance/Product
- Finance approvals for purchases
- Carbon emissions/regional data for sustainability
**Outputs:**
- Guidance to Procurement on usage/plans
- Optimization impact expectations to Planning & Estimating, Forecasting
- Documentation/mini business cases for optimization
- Guidance to teams on anticipated rates
- Unit economics evaluation
