# Data Ingestion

Data Ingestion involves gathering, transferring, processing, transforming, and correlating various datasets to create a queryable, contextualized repository, at the appropriate level of granularity, accessibility, and completeness to support activities in all of the FinOps Capabilities across all FinOps Personas.

## Capability Definition

Data ingestion is a multi-step process that involves importing data from various sources, processing and transforming it, then making it available to the appropriate stakeholders in a format that enables informed decision-making.

## Domain: Understand Usage & Cost

Data Ingestion is fundamental to the "Understand Usage & Cost" Domain as it provides the foundation of data upon which all FinOps activities are built.

## Why Organizations Implement This Capability

Organizations implement the Data Ingestion capability to:

- Create a single source of truth for cloud financial data
- Enable comprehensive visibility into cloud usage and costs
- Support accurate allocation of costs to business units
- Provide the data foundation for optimization activities
- Enable effective anomaly detection
- Support forecasting and budgeting activities
- Allow for meaningful benchmarking

## How Organizations Implement This Capability

### Maturity Assessment: Crawl

In the Crawl stage, organizations typically:
- Gather basic billing and usage data from cloud providers
- Store data in simple formats like CSV or spreadsheets
- Perform manual processing with limited automation
- Have minimal integration with other systems
- Focus on capturing core cost data with limited metadata

### Maturity Assessment: Walk

In the Walk stage, organizations typically:
- Implement automated data collection processes
- Establish data warehouses or repositories
- Integrate multiple data sources beyond just billing
- Include resource metadata and tagging information
- Implement basic data quality checks
- Set up regular data refresh schedules
- Begin correlating cost data with performance metrics

### Maturity Assessment: Run

In the Run stage, organizations typically:
- Implement fully automated, real-time or near-real-time data ingestion
- Integrate comprehensive data sources (billing, usage, performance, security, etc.)
- Implement advanced data transformation and normalization
- Establish robust data governance processes
- Support multiple cloud providers with normalized data models
- Implement advanced data quality verification
- Enable self-service access to data for all relevant stakeholders
- Correlate financial data with business metrics

## Input Dependencies

- Cloud provider billing and usage data
- Cloud resource metadata and tags
- Resource utilization metrics
- Business context (projects, applications, departments)
- Commitment-based discount information (Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, etc.)
- Security and compliance data
- Performance metrics
- Historical usage patterns

## Tool Requirements

- Data ingestion and ETL tools
- Data storage solutions (data warehouses, data lakes)
- Analytics platforms
- API connectors for cloud providers
- Data visualization tools
- Monitoring systems
- Security and access control mechanisms

## Real-World Implementation Examples

- A financial services company implemented a real-time data ingestion pipeline that brings together billing data, resource utilization, and business metrics to create a comprehensive view of cloud costs related to business outcomes.
- A software company created a multi-cloud data ingestion framework that normalizes cost and usage data across AWS, Azure, and GCP into a unified data model.
- A healthcare organization implemented data ingestion processes that include HIPAA compliance metadata to ensure that cloud resources are properly tracked for both cost and regulatory purposes.

## Common Challenges 

- Dealing with data inconsistencies across cloud providers
- Managing the volume and velocity of cloud usage data
- Ensuring data completeness and accuracy
- Handling data latency issues
- Normalizing data formats across different sources
- Correlating technical resource data with business context
- Maintaining data security and access controls
