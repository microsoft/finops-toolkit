# Licensing & SaaS

Understanding and optimizing the impact of software licenses and SaaS investments on an organizationâ€™s cloud cost structure and value by understanding vendor-specific licensing terms, use rights, and pricing options, planning for appropriate use aimed to minimize over-deployment (a compliance risk) or under-deployment (shelfware/waste), and collaborating with finance, procurement, and legal teams.

## Definition

FinOps helps organizations manage the variable use, consumption-based services prevalent in cloud platforms. Licensed software and SaaS products are used alongside IaaS, often with significant cost and value impact. Understanding how licenses and SaaS are purchased, used, and managed is critical, involving Procurement, ITAM/SAM, and Legal. Licenses and SaaS can be purchased via organizational agreements, cloud provider marketplaces, or direct contracts, each with unique terms and risks. Planning and collaboration are required to optimize use and minimize waste or compliance risk.
