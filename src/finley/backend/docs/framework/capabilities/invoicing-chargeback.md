# Invoicing & Chargeback

Developing specific reporting, cloud invoice reconciliation workflows and chargeback models, in direct collaboration with Finance Personas with input from Product and Engineering Personas, to align cloud cost data and reporting to specific budgets and accounting requirements.

## Definition

Managing cloud invoices and creating official chargebacks to the organization’s Finance systems are important processes that must be established as official interactions between the FinOps practice and Finance & Accounting. The goal is to support Finance in allocating invoiced cost to cost centers, in the formats and timing required for accounting. This includes data quality, reporting integrity, and processes for corrections. Chargeback is not always required, but showback is always needed in any FinOps practice.

This capability is closely tied to Data Ingestion, Allocation, and Reporting & Analytics. Tagging/account strategy and shared cost identification are key for effective chargeback.

## Maturity Assessment
- **Crawl**: Chargeback based on estimates, material variance, manual processes, high-level files, flat cost center hierarchy, little automation, only basic collaboration.
- **Walk**: Chargeback based on estimates with some variance, placeholder entries, initial shared cost strategy, centralized tooling, expanded chargeback file, manual validation, more granular cost center hierarchy, active collaboration.
- **Run**: Teams understand direct/shared costs, all discounts charged by consumption, automated/integrated reporting, simultaneous reconciliation, self-sufficient Finance, automated chargeback, detailed files, automated currency conversion, finalized processes, granular allocation.

## Functional Activities
- Receive and validate invoices, manage POs (FinOps)
- Validate and reconcile chargeback data, support teams in reconciliation
- Collaborate with Finance/Accounting on close activities and true-ups
- Review and understand costs, policies, and allocations (Product, Engineering, Leadership)
- Establish compliance and criteria for chargeback (Finance)
- Manage procurement and payment terms (Procurement)

## Measures of Success & KPIs
- Chargeback processing time
- % of invoices paid on time
- General ledger recharge rate
- % accuracy of chargebacks
- % variance in chargeback estimates vs actuals
- Periodic reconciliation, effective reporting, reduced cycle time, increased accountability

## Inputs & Outputs
**Inputs:**
- Tagging standards, allocation data, cost models, reporting, financial policies, cost center hierarchy, payment terms, ledger requirements
**Outputs:**
- Charges executed in financial systems
- Centralized reporting tool
- Feedback to Allocation, Data Ingestion, Reporting & Analytics, Intersecting Disciplines
- Documentation of period close and invoice processing
- Chargeback file for financial system ingestion
