# FinOps Assessment

Conducting repeatable, measurable, thoughtful analysis of the maturity of a FinOps Practice in the context of the [FinOps Framework](https://www.finops.org/framework/) for insights into strengths and areas for improvement of FinOps activities.

## Definition

Assessment of the FinOps practice allows a FinOps team to measure its own effectiveness, map its activities against organizational goals, and identify areas to mature. Assessment enables benchmarking of current capabilities and focuses attention on the most impactful areas for cloud value. Assessments are typically done with a Target Groupâ€”a mix of representative personas. The goal is to understand the current state, define a goal state aligned to objectives, and create a pathway to that goal, attaching KPIs to measure progress.

Assessments are more effective when focused on a subset of Capabilities and a small Target Group, enabling deeper dialogue and understanding. They also foster collaboration, reinforce terminology, and promote a culture of cost awareness. See the [FinOps Assessment Guide and Tool](https://www.finops.org/wg/finops-assessment/) for more details.

## Maturity Assessment

- **Walk**: Semi-annual/quarterly assessment, goals tracked and adjusted, specific capabilities evaluated, consistent format, appointed assessor, assessments with BUs/Champions.
- **Run**: Frequent/quarterly assessments, more capabilities assessed, multiple trained assessors, central repository of assessments, regular cadence in BUs, results shared, proactive training and expectations.
