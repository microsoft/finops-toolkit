# Rate Optimization

Driving cloud rate efficiency through a combination of negotiated discounts, commitment discounts (RIs, Savings Plans, Committed Use Discounts), and other pricing mechanisms to meet the organizationâ€™s operational and budgetary objectives.

## Definition

Rate Optimization helps lower the rate paid for cloud resources. This is achieved through negotiated discounts, resource-based and spend-based commitment discounts (RIs, CUDs, Savings Plans), usage-based discounts, and special programs (e.g., Spot instances). The FinOps team coordinates discount purchases, provides usage data to Procurement, and manages the rate optimization strategy. Rate optimization is closely related to workload optimization and must be balanced to avoid double-counting savings or locking in unoptimized resources. Automation, reporting, and collaboration across personas are key.

## Maturity Assessment
- **Crawl**: Basic strategy, ad hoc purchases, minimal FinOps input, low coverage, situational Spot use.
- **Walk**: Robust strategy, coordinated purchasing, centralized analysis, regular cadence, alerting, evaluation of plans, Spot recommendations.
- **Run**: Automated, metrics-driven management, frequent purchase cycles, automated allocation, bi-directional connection with workload optimization, regular reporting, Spot use integrated, automation for pattern identification, guidance from Licensing/SaaS, Sustainability, and Architecture.
