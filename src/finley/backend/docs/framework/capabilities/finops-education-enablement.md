# FinOps Education & Enablement

Training, skill development, and practical activities that enable teams throughout the organization to adopt and deliver the FinOps practice.

## Definition

FinOps Education & Enablement allows everyone participating in a FinOps practice to develop a common understanding of FinOps concepts, terminology, and practice. This enables collaboration across disciplines and helps build a culture of accountability for cloud costs. The goal is to deliver FinOps knowledge and skills to all personas, continuously reinforcing adoption. This includes certifications, persona-based training, internal/external events, and maintaining internal repositories of documentation and terminology.

Enablement is delivered through internal communications, events, formal/informal training, conferences, business value initiatives, and formal job requirements. Training may target FinOps itself, technical/financial/business topics, or contextualized business functions.
