# Benchmarking

Using efficiency metrics to evaluate cloud optimization and value between parts of the organization or against industry peers to inform decision-making and align FinOps with business objectives.

## Definition

Benchmarking allows organizations to compare unit metrics and [KPIs](https://www.finops.org/wg/finops-kpis/) for important aspects of cloud value and optimization both internally between different teams, and externally with other organizations using cloud in similar ways.

FinOps teams should work with Leadership, Product, and Engineering personas to identify or define unit metrics or KPIs that would provide insights into the organization’s cloud use by being benchmarked.

Internal benchmarking between different segments of the organization, or between product or engineering teams, can assist in decision making related to cloud value and optimization. Internal benchmarking programs can be implemented with clear definition of benchmarked metrics, transparent communication of goals and objectives, accurate data collection and dashboarding, supportive management, and can be more effective with gamification or incentive programs to drive desired behavior.

External benchmarking should be performed carefully to protect sensitive information. The FinOps Foundation community and State of FinOps data can provide useful insights. Every organization’s cloud usage will be unique, so benchmarking should be one activity among many for assessing cloud value and efficiency.

## Maturity Assessment
- **Crawl**: Broad or technical KPIs identified, informal internal comparisons.
- **Walk**: Variety of KPIs/metrics, mechanisms for internal comparison, self-service, informal external sharing.
- **Run**: Curated KPIs/metrics, consistent internal reporting, incentives, established external benchmarking networks, participation in industry programs.

## Functional Activities
- Translate efficiency goals into KPIs and metrics (FinOps)
- Establish and manage benchmarking programs
- Achieve and report on benchmarking goals (Product, Engineering, Finance)
- Set KPIs/metrics to benchmark (Leadership)
- Provide benchmarking examples from related disciplines (Allied Personas)

## Measures of Success & KPIs
- Targeted, well-documented KPIs for benchmarking
- Internal teams provide benchmark opportunities
- Leadership and FinOps can compare high-level performance externally

## Inputs & Outputs
- Unit Economics: KPIs for decision making
- Reporting & Analytics: dashboards and reporting for benchmarking
- Points of comparison from external organizations
