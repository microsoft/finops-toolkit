# Onboarding Workloads

Orchestrating the migration of systems into, or between, cloud environments in a way that provides transparency to cost, usage, and impact; supports operational objectives; and establishes or maintains cost effectiveness.

## Definition

Moving workloads into or between cloud environments requires planning, coordination, stakeholder alignment, and an organizational strategy. Onboarding is often triggered by data center reduction, mergers, new technology adoption, or cost optimization. A formal onboarding strategy and migration plan are critical, involving Engineering, Finance, Leadership, Product, and Allied Personas. Cost efficiency is best achieved by designing for it early, and onboarding must consider tagging, compliance, automation, and forecast models. KPIs are essential to measure migration success and avoid costly parallel operations.

## Maturity Assessment
- **Crawl**: Small needs, ad-hoc budgeting, manual landing zones, little collaboration.
- **Walk**: Structured, repeatable process, persona involvement, regular reviews, mandatory estimating/forecasting/budgeting, automation in landing zones, central usage reporting.
- **Run**: Automated, continuous onboarding, all personas involved, well-defined process, automation with Infrastructure as Code, standardized budgeting/forecasting, robust migration monitoring.

## Functional Activities
- Create onboarding strategy (FinOps, Product, Engineering, Leadership)
- Ensure tagging, compliance, automation, migration patterns (FinOps)
- Assess workload suitability, operational readiness, leverage automation (Engineering)
- Assess financial viability, track value realization (Finance)
- Review contractual impacts, open source tools (Procurement)
- Optimize product with cloud capabilities, advocate for cost efficiency (Product)
- Prioritize workloads, provide strategic direction (Leadership)
- Support onboarding with domain expertise (Allied Personas)

## Measures of Success & KPIs
- Cost efficiency (infrastructure savings, migration/support costs)
- Operational resiliency (service quality, security posture)
- Decreased time to market
