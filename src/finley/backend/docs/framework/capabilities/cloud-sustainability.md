# Cloud Sustainability

Incorporating sustainability criteria and metrics into cloud optimization, to ensure environmental efficiency is balanced with financial value, and cloud optimization decisions are aligned with organizational goals.

## Definition

Cloud Sustainability defines how the organization will make decisions about using cloud in ways that consider both its impact on the environment and the organization’s broader sustainability goals. This allows engineers and product personas to balance environmental considerations alongside financial costs or benefits when architecting, optimizing, and deploying workloads in the cloud.

FinOps teams should integrate with organizational sustainability programs, incorporate sustainability information into cloud usage and value domains, and identify opportunities for optimization that support sustainability goals. Recommendations from optimization domains can be evaluated to select options that produce the best value—financial, environmental, or operational.

Sustainability data from cloud providers will vary in scope and quality. The primary goal is to use available data to make recommendations, even if imperfect, about sustainable cloud use. Collaboration among teams is crucial to balance tradeoffs between cost, speed, quality, and sustainability.

## Maturity Assessment
- **Crawl**: Basic understanding of cloud’s environmental impact, some carbon data, optimization focused on elasticity, broad tradeoff decisions.
- **Walk**: Awareness across teams, mechanisms to reduce carbon, more granular data, optimization includes re-architecting, granular tradeoff decisions.
- **Run**: Organization-wide awareness, sustainability in migration/optimization, normalized granular reporting, sustainability considered in architecture and workload placement.

## Functional Activities
- Collaborate with Sustainability teams (FinOps, Allied Personas)
- Provide requirements to improve data granularity and quality
- Ensure teams understand how resource provisioning supports sustainability
- Develop sustainability optimizations alongside workload/rate optimization
- Align reporting and metrics to show sustainability impacts
- Enable sustainable workload decisions with clear, relevant data
- Drive sustainability optimization in product strategy (Product)
- Balance sustainable and cost-effective options (Finance, Procurement)
- Deploy elastic solutions and minimize waste (Engineering)
- Set and review sustainability OKRs/KPIs (Leadership)

## Measures of Success & KPIs
- Sustainability reports available and normalized across providers
- Visibility of sustainability data alongside cost data
- Communication and tracking of sustainability targets (e.g., carbon budgets)
- Sustainability considered in migration/optimization
- Clear guidelines for optimization tradeoffs
- Key terms: mtCO2e, kgCO2e, Liters of H2O, MWh/kWh, m3 of water, ESG, CO2e, SDG, GHG

## Inputs & Outputs
- Data from Data Ingestion, cloud providers, vendors
- Contextual information and recommendations for carbon reduction
- Reporting & Analytics, Unit Economics, Training, Intersecting Disciplines
