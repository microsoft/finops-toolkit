# Policy & Governance

Establishing and evolving policies, controls, and governance mechanisms to ensure that cloud use and intersecting FinOps Scopes align with business objectives, comply with regulatory requirements, and optimize cloud resources efficiently.

## Definition

Policy and Governance are statements of intent and the mechanisms to ensure adherence. Policy is a clear statement describing how cloud activities are executed to deliver business value. Governance is the set of processes, tooling, or guardrails that control activity to promote desired outcomes. Together, they establish and sustain a FinOps culture, align cloud activities with business strategy, and support consistent adoption of best practices. Governance includes mechanisms to enforce policy and KPIs to measure compliance, shared transparently to drive valuable behavior. Policy & Governance interacts with all FinOps Capabilities and operational groups (IT Security, ITAM, CCoE, DevOps, etc.).

## Maturity Assessment
- **Crawl**: Policy & Governance as part of overall business policy, basic risk control, ad-hoc/reactive policy creation, manual training/analysis/reporting.
- **Walk**: Broadened/standardized measures, cross-functional collaboration, integration with org policies, proactive review, routine training, vendor analytics tooling.
- **Run**: Integrated with business strategy, automated compliance review/trending, integration with new architectures, enriched insights/automation.
