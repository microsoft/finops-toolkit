# Planning & Estimating

Estimation and exploration of potential cost and value, alongside opportunities for automation, sustainability, and optimization, for workloads if implemented in an organizationâ€™s cloud environment in a particular model or models.

## Definition

Estimating future cloud costs requires robust practices due to the variety of services, frequent updates, and deployment models. Estimation can be for any scope, from a single service to an entire migration. Engineering leads estimation, with input from FinOps, Product, Finance, and Leadership. Estimating is exploratory and feeds into Forecasting, supporting migration, implementation, and optimization planning. Techniques include cost calculators, carbon calculators, similar application comparisons, extrapolation from past costs, phased implementation, and trial-run estimation. Estimates should consider pricing, policy, shared costs, sustainability, and operational impacts.

## Maturity Assessment
- **Crawl**: Simple build patterns, low accuracy/granularity, ad-hoc/manual documentation, trend-based, limited visibility, few shared costs, engineering involved but little tracking, basic carbon awareness.
- **Walk**: Complex patterns, granular/accurate estimates, inclusive of discounts/carbon, regular cadence, consistent documentation, all personas have access, regular review of accuracy/trends.
- **Run**: Complex/large-scale patterns, highly granular, includes shared/platform/support/sustainability costs, multiple pricing models, supports rolling/trend/driver-based forecasting, real-time visibility, automated data flow with accounting/ESG systems.

## Functional Activities
- Establish estimating requirements/parameters (FinOps)
- Generate granular estimates, align KPIs, provide reporting
- Track product KPIs, collaborate on carbon KPIs (Product)
- Set accuracy/detail requirements, provide data, enable trial funding (Finance)
- Monitor triggers, lead estimating, design for cost/optimization/carbon (Engineering)
- Support estimation, manage priorities, foster communication (Leadership)
- Provide carbon actuals/estimates, collaborate on sustainability goals (Sustainability)

## Measures of Success & KPIs
- Discount-adjusted, amortized data
- Estimate vs. actual cost trends within variance thresholds
- Timely, business-aligned estimates
- Inclusion of shared costs, pricing, sustainability
- Unit costs and usage KPIs

## Inputs & Outputs
**Inputs:**
- Triggers from optimization, onboarding, analytics, forecasting
- System/workload details, requirements, scenarios, desired state
- Architectural guidelines, estimate parameters, ESG standards
- Data validation
**Outputs:**
- Scenario cost, carbon, and delivery estimates
- Recommendations and risk/confidence levels
- Data quality scorecard
