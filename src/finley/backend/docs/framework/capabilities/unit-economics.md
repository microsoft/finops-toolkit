# Unit Economics

Unit Economics involves developing and tracking metrics that provide an understanding of how an organization's cloud use and cloud management practices impact the value of the organization's products, services, or activities.

## Capability Definition

Unit Economics in FinOps is the practice of understanding and optimizing the relationship between cloud costs and business value by establishing metrics that connect technology spend to business outcomes.

## Domain: Quantify Business Value

Unit Economics is a key capability within the "Quantify Business Value" Domain as it provides the linkage between technical costs and business outcomes.

## Why Organizations Implement This Capability

Organizations implement the Unit Economics capability to:

- Connect cloud spending to business outcomes and value
- Make informed decisions about cloud investments
- Justify cloud spending to stakeholders
- Identify opportunities to optimize the cost-to-value ratio
- Compare efficiency across products, services, or business units
- Support cloud financial management decisions with business context
- Track improvement in cloud efficiency over time
- Demonstrate the ROI of cloud optimization initiatives

## How Organizations Implement This Capability

### Maturity Assessment: Crawl

In the Crawl stage, organizations typically:
- Identify basic unit metrics relevant to the business
- Establish manual processes for connecting costs to business units
- Calculate simple cost-per-unit metrics (e.g., cost per customer)
- Have limited granularity in unit measurements
- Perform periodic, manual unit economic analyses
- Focus on a small number of high-level metrics
- Have limited distribution of unit economic reporting

### Maturity Assessment: Walk

In the Walk stage, organizations typically:
- Develop more sophisticated unit metrics specific to products or services
- Implement automated collection of business metrics
- Create regular reporting on unit economics
- Establish targets for unit economic improvement
- Integrate unit metrics into decision-making processes
- Enable product-level or service-level visibility
- Begin tracking unit economics over time to identify trends

### Maturity Assessment: Run

In the Run stage, organizations typically:
- Implement comprehensive unit economic frameworks across the organization
- Create real-time visibility into unit economic performance
- Use advanced analytics to identify optimization opportunities
- Integrate unit economics into product development and architecture decisions
- Establish detailed unit economic models for different customer segments or use cases
- Implement predictive modeling for unit economic impacts
- Use unit economics as a primary driver for cloud strategy decisions

## Input Dependencies

- Cloud cost and usage data
- Business metrics (customers, transactions, revenue, etc.)
- Product or service usage statistics
- Customer segmentation information
- Revenue and profitability data
- Organizational structure and cost allocation
- Historical performance data

## Tool Requirements

- Business intelligence platforms
- Data integration capabilities
- Cloud cost management tools
- Custom metric collection systems
- Visualization and dashboard tools
- Analytics platforms
- Data warehousing solutions

## Real-World Implementation Examples

- An e-commerce company tracks cloud cost per order and cloud cost as a percentage of order value, allowing them to evaluate the efficiency of their technology investments across different product categories.
- A SaaS provider established a cloud cost per customer metric differentiated by customer tier, helping them understand the profitability of different customer segments and inform pricing strategies.
- A financial services firm tracks transaction processing costs by type, allowing them to identify high-cost transaction types and optimize the corresponding systems.

## Common Challenges 

- Identifying meaningful unit metrics that connect to business value
- Collecting consistent business metrics across different systems
- Aligning technical cost data with business activity periods
- Handling shared services and platform costs in unit allocations
- Accounting for fixed vs. variable costs in unit calculations
- Managing complexity in multi-product or multi-service environments
- Maintaining accuracy as business models evolve
