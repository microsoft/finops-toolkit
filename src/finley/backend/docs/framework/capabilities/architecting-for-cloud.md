# Architecting for Cloud

Designing and modernizing solutions with cost-awareness and efficiency to maximize business value while achieving performance, scalability, and operational objectives.

## Definition

One of the most powerful benefits of using the cloud to build systems is the ability to use a wide range of components and services to satisfy a wide range of requirements. Engineering and product teams make decisions based on the needs of the application, the knowledge and abilities of the programmers, the desired operations environment, and other factors to meet customer or stakeholder demand.

Cloud providers and platform vendors offer Well-Architected or Cloud Adoption frameworks to guide engineers in building effectively in the cloud, making effective choices and tradeoffs—including security, performance, reliability, sustainability, and cost efficiency.

With the introduction of FinOps and broader use of cloud, engineering and product teams not only have the responsibility to choose services that meet operational requirements, but also the sustainability and financial viability of those systems.

Cost efficiency is best achieved by architecting it into a system’s design, or as early in the life of a system as possible. By beginning with the end goals in mind, we can architect to meet redundancy, security, reliability, carbon efficiency, or cost efficiency more easily by avoiding tech debt.

Throughout the lifecycle of every application running in the cloud, organizations must assess when it is time to adjust architectural designs. Analysis of where spending or waste is high, or where value isn’t being achieved, will help identify systems which could benefit from architectural modernization. A regular cadence of analysis should be undertaken to assess where architecting for cloud can benefit the organization.

This capability is closely related to other capabilities in the Optimize Usage & Cost domain, such as Rate Optimization and Workload Optimization, and informs migration and modernization decisions.

## Maturity Assessment
- **Crawl**: Few applications/patterns, informal review, engineers evaluate options individually.
- **Walk**: More applications/patterns, regular formal reviews, active development of cost-effective patterns, involvement from vendors and outside sources.
- **Run**: Many applications, complex architectures, frequent and structured reviews, formalized modernization programs, post-modernization evaluation, continuous improvement.

## Functional Activities
- Assess financial viability and modernization impacts (FinOps, Finance)
- Capture and track cloud value benefits
- Educate and maintain competence in cloud services (Product)
- Evaluate products for new cloud capabilities
- Maintain awareness of cloud services and patterns (Engineering)
- Assess cloud suitability and operational readiness
- Make informed decisions to prioritize modernization (Leadership)
- Provide strategic direction for reinvestment of savings

## Measures of Success & KPIs
- Cost efficiency (infrastructure, migration, support savings)
- Operational resiliency (service quality, security posture)
- Decreased time to market
- Enablement of rapid experimentation and innovation
- Embedded environmental and social sustainability

## Inputs & Outputs

**Inputs:**
- Infrastructure, support, and modernization costs
- Value metrics for systems
- Service quality, security, operational stability
- Developer productivity, release frequency, business agility
- Return on innovation, employee/customer satisfaction
- Carbon footprint, power usage effectiveness

**Outputs:**
- Triage and cadence for modernization analysis
- Prioritized list of opportunities to modernize, architect, or redesign systems
