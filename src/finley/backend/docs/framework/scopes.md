# FinOps Scopes

A FinOps Scope is a segment of technology-related spending to which FinOps Practitioners apply FinOps concepts. Scopes help frame conversations and expectations about which Personas, Domains, and Capabilities are in-scope for the FinOps practice.

## Key Concepts

- Scopes may operate across multiple types of infrastructure (e.g., AI, Licensing).
- There may be multiple Scopes within a single type of spend (e.g., Public Cloud).
- Unique KPIs and thresholds for metrics may be associated with a Capability in a Scope, even if that Capability is included in other Scopes.
- Organizations can determine their own custom FinOps Scope(s) based on the mix of technologies and spend that is important to their business.
- Framework Capabilities can be prioritized or excluded by Scope based on business objectives.
- FinOps Personas can be engaged or excluded as appropriate for each FinOps Scope.

### Scopes are more than a single type of infrastructure

A Scope may operate across multiple types of infrastructure (e.g. AI or Licensing). There may be multiple Scopes within a single type of spend (e.g. Public Cloud). Unique KPIs and thresholds for metrics may be associated with a Capability in a Scope, even if that Capability is included in other Scopes.

### Scopes are driven by the business & technology strategy

Organizations can determine their own custom FinOps Scope(s) based on the mix of technologies and spend that is important to their business. Framework Capabilities can be prioritized or excluded by Scope based on business objectives. FinOps Personas can be engaged or excluded as appropriate for each FinOps Scope.

### Scopes determine which Personas, Domains, and Capabilities are Engaged

We can visualize the concept of creating a FinOps Scope by viewing the Framework poster from the top-down. For example: a Framework poster highlighting a sample FinOps Scope for AI or Licensing, each individually surface which Personas, Domains, and Capabilities may be involved as driven by business and technology priorities.

## Example Scopes

- **Public Cloud**: Remains the foundational FinOps Scope, addressing cost management challenges of cloud.
- **Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)**: Highlights which Personas, Domains, and Capabilities may be involved in the FinOps Scope for SaaS.
- **Data Center**: Highlights which Personas, Domains, and Capabilities may be involved in the FinOps Scope for Data Center.
- **AI**: FinOps for AI is an emerging scope.
- **Licensing**: Managing licensing costs as a distinct scope.
