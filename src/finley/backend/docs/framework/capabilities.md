### FinOps Capabilities

#### Allocation
Define strategies to assign and share cloud costs using accounts, tags, labels, and other metadata, creating accountability among teams and projects within an organization.

#### Anomaly Management
Gives a FinOps team the ability to detect, identify, clarify, alert on, and manage unexpected cloud cost events in a timely manner, in order to minimize impact to the business.

#### Architecting for Cloud
Engineering and product teams choose services that meet operational requirements, sustainability, and financial viability.

#### Benchmarking
Allows organizations to compare unit metrics and KPIs for important aspects of cloud value and optimization both internally and externally.

#### Budgeting
Strategic and ongoing process for setting limits, monitoring, and managing cloud spending, aligned with business objectives.

#### Cloud Sustainability
Defines how the organization will make decisions about using cloud in ways that consider both its impact on the environment and the organization’s broader sustainability goals.

#### Data Ingestion
Involves gathering, transferring, processing, transforming, and correlating various datasets to create a queryable, contextualized repository.

#### FinOps Assessment
Allows a FinOps team to measure its own effectiveness, map its activities against the goals of the organization, and identify areas for improvement.
