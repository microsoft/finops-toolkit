# FinOps Principles

FinOps Principles act as a north star, guiding the activities of a FinOps practice. These principles are in no particular order and should be taken as a whole. All members are encouraged to understand and practice all of these principles.

## Principles

### 1. Teams need to collaborate

Finance, technology, product, and business teams work together in near real time as the cloud operates on a per-resource, per-second basis. Teams work together to continuously improve for efficiency and innovation.

### 2. Business value drives technology decisions

Unit economic and value-based metrics demonstrate business impact better than aggregate spend. Make conscious trade-off decisions among cost, quality, and speed. Think of cloud as a driver of innovation. Think of FinOps Scopes as a driver of business value.

### 3. Everyone takes ownership for their technology usage

Accountability of usage and cost is pushed to the edge, with engineers taking ownership of costs from architecture design to ongoing operations. Individual feature and product teams are empowered to manage their own usage of cloud and intersecting technologies against their budget. Decentralize the decision making around cost-effective architecture, resource usage, and optimization. Technical teams must begin to consider cost as a new efficiency metric from the beginning of the software development lifecycle.

### 4. FinOps data should be accessible, timely, and accurate

Process and share cost data as soon as it becomes available. Real-time visibility autonomously drives better cloud and technology utilization. Fast feedback loops result in more efficient behavior. Consistent visibility into cloud and technology spend is provided to all levels of the organization. Create, monitor, and improve real-time financial forecasting and planning. Trending and variance analysis helps explain why costs increased. Internal team benchmarking drives best practices and celebrates wins. Industry peer-level benchmarking assesses your companyâ€™s performance.

### 5. FinOps should be enabled centrally

The central team encourages, evangelizes, and enables best practices in a shared accountability model, much like security, which has a central team yet everyone remains responsible for their portion of technology use. Executive buy-in for FinOps and its practices and processes is required. Rate, commitment, and discount optimization are centralized to take advantage of economies of scale. Remove the need for engineers and operations teams to think about rate negotiations, allowing them to stay focused on usage optimization of their own environments.

### 6. Take advantage of the variable cost model of the cloud

The variable cost model of the cloud should be viewed as an opportunity to deliver more value, not as a risk. Embrace just-in-time prediction, planning, and purchasing of capacity. Agile iterative planning is preferred over static long-term plans.
