# FinOps Maturity Model

The practice of FinOps is inherently iterative and maturity of any given process, functional activity, Capability, or Domain will improve with repetition.

A “Crawl, Walk, Run” approach enables organizations to start small and grow in scale, scope, and complexity as business value warrants maturing a functional activity. Quick action at a small scale and limited scope allows FinOps teams to assess outcomes and gain insights into the value of taking further action in a larger, faster, or more granular way.

## Maturity Levels

### Crawl
Maturity Level Characteristics: Very little reporting and tooling. Basic KPIs set for the measurement of success. Plans to address "low hanging fruit."
- Very little reporting and tooling
- Basic KPIs set for measurement of success
- Basic processes and policies defined
- Capability is understood but not followed by all major teams
- Plans to address “low hanging fruit”
- **Sample KPIs:**
  - Allocate at least 50% of spend
  - Resource-based commitments discount target coverage ~60%
  - Forecast spend to actual spend accuracy variance is 20%

### Walk
Maturity Level Characteristics: Capability is understood and followed within the organization. Automation and/or processes cover most of the Capability requirements.
- Capability is understood and followed within the organization
- Automation/processes cover most requirements
- Difficult edge cases identified and estimated
- Medium to high goals/KPIs set
- **Sample KPIs:**
  - Allocate at least 80% of spend
  - Resource-based commitments discount target coverage ~70%
  - Forecast spend to actual spend accuracy variance is 15%

### Run
Maturity Level Characteristics: Capability is understood and followed by all teams within the organization. Automation is the preferred approach. Very high goals/KPIs set on the measurement of success.
- Capability is understood and followed by all teams
- Difficult edge cases are being addressed
- Very high goals/KPIs set
- Automation is the preferred approach
- **Sample KPIs:**
  - Greater than 90% of spend can be allocated
  - Resource-based commitments discount target coverage ~80%
  - Forecast spend to actual spend accuracy variance is 12%

## Guidance
- Not every Capability needs to reach “Run” maturity—focus on outcomes that provide the highest business value.
- Every Capability and functional activity can be at a different level of maturity.
- Use the [FinOps Assessment](https://www.finops.org/wg/finops-assessment/) and rubric to indicate current state and communicate effectively.
