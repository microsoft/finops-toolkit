# Optimize Usage & Cost

Activities in this Domain enable value through optimization for cloud and intersecting [FinOps Scopes](https://www.finops.org/topic/scopes/) by designing and building systems effectively, reducing waste and unnecessary usage over time, and optimizing rates paid for resources.

Within this Domain, organizations take action throughout the lifecycle of their cloud and technology estates to introduce and improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of their design and deployment. Organizations will measure efficiency in a variety of ways, including monetary cost, carbon usage, or more traditional IT operational efficiency measures. Actions in this Domain will include managing the types and amounts of cloud and technology resources used, when they are used, and the rates that are paid for required resources.

Optimizing cloud and technology usage requires action by many Personas across an organization continuously through the life of its cloud systems. This Domain contains the Capabilities which allow engineering groups to architect, design, build, operate, and continuously optimize applications for cost-effective operation. Architecting for cloud, effective resource utilization, responsibly acting on the impact of carbon use, reacting to changes in usage requirements or new cloud services, using licensed and SaaS models appropriately, and cost effective operational practices all lead to efficient use of cloud and other technology investments.

Likewise, leadership, procurement, and finance personas will be involved in defining and maintaining a portfolio of commitments which will allow for the purchase and use of required resources at lower cost and/or with lower carbon footprint to meet the risk profile and business objectives of the organization.

This Domain ensures organizations use resources only when and where they provide the most value to the organization; and the impact of cost, including the opportunity to optimize rates, is factored into resource purchase decisions along with architecture choices, carbon or other metrics important for meeting the organizationâ€™s goals.

## Capabilities in this Domain
- [Architecting for Cloud](../capabilities/architecting-for-cloud.md)
- [Rate Optimization](../capabilities/rate-optimization.md)
- [Workload Optimization](../capabilities/workload-optimization.md)
- [Cloud Sustainability](../capabilities/cloud-sustainability.md)
- [Licensing & SaaS](../capabilities/licensing-saas.md)

## Key Activities
- Analyze and manage spend-based commitments and resource-based commitments
- Optimize resource utilization and efficiency by building both manual and automated policies to help teams with how they use cloud services across the infrastructure
- Design solutions with cost-awareness to maximize business value and achieve performance, scalability, and operational objectives
- Establish strategic metrics and criteria for incorporating sustainability goals into other FinOps Capabilities
- Develop approaches for understanding and optimizing the use of software licenses and SaaS investments
- Leverage [FOCUS](https://focus.finops.org/) to standardize efficiency KPIs

## Supported FinOps Principles
- Teams need to collaborate
- Business value drives technology decisions
- Everyone takes ownership for their technology usage
- Take advantage of the variable cost model of the cloud

## Outcomes
Optimizing Usage & Cost Answers the Questions:
- Are engineering and product teams taking initiative to be responsible for their cloud and technology use?
- Are we making appropriate architecture, system design, license use, and operational feature choices when building in the cloud or choosing other technologies?
- Are we making appropriate architecture, system design, license use, and operational feature choices when considering building with technologies beyond the cloud?
- Are we matching our resource usage over time and in the location to the demand required to meet our organizational goals?
- Are we paying an appropriate amount in financial cost and carbon usage to meet our goals and risk tolerance?
