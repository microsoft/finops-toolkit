# Quantify Business Value

In addition to understanding cloud usage and cost, organizations must also develop an understanding of how that cost maps to the value technology beyond cloud creates for stakeholders.

This Domain connects usage with business value to ensure the impact and value created for that usage is transparently within expectations. Organizations map cloud and technology usage – with corresponding cost metrics – to budgets, use historical information and future plans to forecast, establish and measure KPIs and other performance indicators, and perform benchmarking between teams and with other organizations.

Organizations should consider both costs and value in the cloud in monetary terms, in terms of sustainability, and in the context of traditional IT or organizational performance metrics like application availability, reliability, or customer satisfaction.

## Capabilities in this Domain
- [Planning & Estimating](../capabilities/planning-estimating.md)
- [Forecasting](../capabilities/forecasting.md)
- [Budgeting](../capabilities/budgeting.md)
- [Benchmarking](../capabilities/benchmarking.md)
- [Unit Economics](../capabilities/unit-economics.md)

## Key Activities
- Plan, estimate, and forecast needs for cloud plus intersecting [FinOps Scopes](https://www.finops.org/topic/scopes/) using relevant cost, impact, and usage data
- Enable teams to budget consistently and decrease probability of budgetary overrun
- Define techniques and models to establish benchmarks tied to business value
- Develop metrics that are based on objective measurements to reveal the business value of cloud and technology being used by the organization

## Supported FinOps Principles
- Business value drives technology decisions
- FinOps data should be accessible, timely, and accurate
- Take advantage of the variable cost model of the cloud

## Outcomes
At its core, this Domain answers these questions:
- What value do we expect to achieve from our cloud and technology use?
- How will we measure that value?
- Does what we’re using and spending allow us to achieve our strategic and organizational objectives?
- Is what we’re using and spending commensurate with other comparable examples?
