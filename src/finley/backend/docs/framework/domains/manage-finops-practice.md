# Manage the FinOps Practice

This Domain enables continuous improvement to change and align the entire organization – its people, processes and technology – to adopt FinOps and use cloud and other technology in ways that create value for the company.

Within this Domain, Capabilities are centered on effective FinOps operation, enablement of the whole organization to get the most value from its [FinOps Scopes](https://www.finops.org/topic/scopes/) through improved interaction with all other personas and business functions to support and represent cloud use more effectively.

Organizations take action to build and manage an effective FinOps team and culture, using training, tools, assessments, and governance to promote accountability generally across the organization, and specifically with Finance and other disciplines in the organization, which require specific FinOps data or insights to perform their broader duties.
