# FinOps Domains

Domains are the outcomes of a FinOps practice. The Domains of the FinOps Framework describe the fundamental business outcomes organizations should achieve from the FinOps practice. Practicing FinOps allows organizations to understand their cloud usage and cost, quantify its business value, optimize both usage and rates paid, and manage an effective practice.

Each Domain describes a set of Capabilities an organization can perform to achieve these outcomes. Organizations should develop the Capabilities that provide them value, according to their needs and their organization’s current [FinOps Maturity Level](https://www.finops.org/framework/maturity-model/). While every organization won’t invest in every Capability, every organization using cloud, plus managing [Scopes](https://www.finops.org/framework/scopes) of technology in addition to cloud, will perform activities in each of the FinOps Domains.

## Domains

### 1. Understand Usage & Cost
The outcome of this Domain is a better understanding of an organization's use of cloud plus intersecting FinOps Scopes. Activities in this Domain define the organizational metadata to categorize, allocate, and summarize cloud and technology cost and usage.
- Gather all information required to perform FinOps (cost, usage, observability, utilization, sustainability, etc.).
- Define organizational metadata to categorize, allocate, and summarize cost and usage.
- Define reporting and analytics processes for all FinOps Personas.
- **Domain Capabilities:** [Data Ingestion](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/data-ingestion/), [Allocation](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/allocation/), [Reporting & Analytics](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/reporting-analytics/), [Anomaly Management](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/anomaly-management/)

### 2. Quantify Business Value
Organizations develop Capabilities in this Domain to connect the usage and cost data with the business value it creates, helping ensure value is transparent and within expectations.
- Connect usage and cost data with business value.
- Map costs to budgets, forecast, establish and measure KPIs, and perform benchmarking.

### 3. Optimize Usage & Cost
This Domain focuses on value through optimization, ensuring organizations only use the resources when they provide value to the organization.
- Ensure resources are used only when they provide value and are purchased at the lowest acceptable cost.
- Address architecture modernization, sustainability, and SaaS optimization.
- **Domain Capabilities:** [Architecting for Cloud](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/architecting-for-cloud/), [Rate Optimization](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/rate-optimization/), [Workload Optimization](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/workload-optimization/), [Cloud Sustainability](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/cloud-sustainability/), [Licensing & SaaS](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/licensing-saas/)

### 4. Manage the FinOps Practice
This Domain enables continuous improvement to change and align the entire organization to adopt FinOps and apply the Framework to its FinOps Scopes in ways that create value for the company.
- Enable continuous improvement and alignment of people, processes, and technology.
