# FinOps Scopes

FinOps Scopes represent segments of cloud and technology-related spending to which FinOps concepts can be applied. Each scope has its own unique characteristics, but all benefit from the application of FinOps principles and capabilities.

## What are FinOps Scopes?

FinOps Scopes are the segments of cloud and technology-related spending to which FinOps concepts can be applied. Organizations can apply the FinOps Framework to multiple FinOps Scopes, because of similarities in how the technologies are consumed and charged.

The Framework will continue to expand to include more FinOps Scopes. Current discussions include (but aren't limited to): AI/ML, Database as a Service, Data Transfers, Identity as a Service, Intelligent Document Processing, Software as a Service, and Telecom.

## Current FinOps Scopes

### Cloud Infrastructure & Platform Services (CIPS)

Cloud Infrastructure & Platform Services refers to the full range of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and similar cloud computing resources that an organization consumes from the major cloud providers. These have traditionally been the primary focus of FinOps practices.

This scope covers virtualized resources such as:
- Compute resources
- Storage
- Networking
- Platform services 
- Managed services
- Serverless functions
- Container environments

### Kubernetes & Containers

This scope focuses on container orchestration platforms, predominantly Kubernetes, both as a service from cloud providers and self-managed installations. Container environments present unique challenges for cost allocation and optimization due to their dynamic nature and abstraction from the underlying infrastructure.

Key aspects include:
- Container resource allocation and utilization
- Pod and node optimization
- Namespace and label-based cost allocation
- Multi-tenant cluster cost distribution
- Idle resource management

### Cloud Carbon Footprint

This scope addresses the environmental impact of cloud usage, focusing on measuring, managing, and optimizing the carbon emissions associated with cloud computing resources.

Key aspects include:
- Carbon emissions measurement
- Energy efficiency optimization
- Sustainable architecture decisions
- Carbon-aware workload scheduling
- Environmental impact reporting

### Edge Computing

Edge computing distributes computing resources closer to data sources and end users, improving response times and reducing bandwidth usage. This scope covers the financial management of these distributed resources.

Key aspects include:
- Distributed infrastructure cost management
- Local vs. cloud processing cost tradeoffs
- Data transfer optimization
- Hardware lifecycle management
- Regional pricing variations

### Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AI/ML)

AI/ML workloads have unique cost profiles with high computational requirements, specialized hardware needs, and complex development cycles. This emerging scope addresses the financial management challenges specific to these workloads.

Key aspects include:
- Training vs. inference cost management
- Specialized hardware (GPU, TPU) optimization
- Model efficiency and cost-effectiveness
- Development vs. production environment costs
- Data storage and processing costs
