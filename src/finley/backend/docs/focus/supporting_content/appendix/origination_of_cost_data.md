## Discussion / Scratch space

- Provider is the entity through which you're purchasing the products regardless of the purchasing mechanism
- Publisher value matches who developed or produced the customer-facing infrastructure, software or services regardless of the purchasing mechanism. Where the resources and/or services are provided as a 'managed' offering, the branded name of the managed offering may be used as the publisher. E.g. If managed Kubernetes was provided via EKS / AKS / GKE / Internal cloud, the publisher would be the cloud providers, not the Kubernetes project or the CNCF.
- Invoice Issuer always matches who did the billing for the transaction regardless of the purchasing mechanism.
  - Invoice Issuer oddities:
    - There would be differentiation between (e.g.) Google France SarL and Google, Inc. USA even though it's really "one Google"
    - Azure in China is operated by SomeCompany, so this will be the Invoice Issuer, even if it looks like you are buying it from Microsoft. ("franchise model")

- Cost reporting queries currently not possible with the current columns:
  - Total cost of resources and/or services running on a particular provider (e.g., AWS)\
    In order to answer this query we would either need another dimension that can show the platform delivering the infra/services OR switch provider to show this value.
    - Invalid query: group by provider, sum (invoice cost OR amortized cost) will include cost of other software and services that have been purchased on AWS (e.g. cases 7,8,9 above)Â 
    - Invalid query: group by publisher, sum (invoice cost OR amortized cost) will exclude cost of 3rd party software/services purchased on marketplace that runs on your AWS environment (e.g. cases 6 above)
