# Column: ServiceCategory

## Example provider mappings

Current column mappings found in available data sets:

| Provider  | Data set                 | Column                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| AWS       | CUR                      | None                                       |
| GCP       | Big Query Billing Export | None                                       |
| Microsoft | Cost details             | ServiceFamily is close, but based on usage |
| OCI | Cost reports | Closest thing is column product/service in cost reports |

## Discussion / Scratch space

Principles behind Service Category, granularity, when to add, when to split etc.

- Every category must represent a single technology. Do not "and" multiple categories together unless they are synonymous.
- Each category should be unique and should not be a logical child of another category (e.g., Containers are a subclassification of Compute).
- Categories are used for cost classification purposes only. Do not create new categories for marketing differentiation (e.g., Containers).
- Avoid unnecessary words. Prefer short, concise names.
- Each service should have 1 and only 1 category that best aligns to its purpose.
- Each category should have around 3-10 services for the major cloud providers. Avoid categories with only 1 or with over 20 services. No category should have more than 20% of services.
- Do not create categories that describe traits of the service that could be applied to many categories (e.g., "serverless").
- Beyond purely cost categorization purposes, the category is based on the primary function the service intends to solve.

Note: While a service can only be in one category, usage/cost for that service may include charges related to another category. For example, resources under the Databases category can have storage and compute cost - however, the primary function of the overall service is to provide database functionality therefore itâ€™s considered to be under the database category.
