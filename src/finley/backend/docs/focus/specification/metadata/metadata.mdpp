# Metadata

The FOCUS specification defines a metadata structure to be supplied by data providers to facilitate practitioners' use of FOCUS data. This metadata includes general information about the data generator and the schema of the [*FOCUS dataset*](#glossary:FOCUS-dataset).

FOCUS Metadata SHOULD be provided in a format that is accessible programmatically, such as a file, website, API, or table. Providers SHOULD provide documentation on their implementation of the FOCUS metadata.
