# Use Case Library

This specification is based on a set of common FinOps use cases, which are publicly available at [https://focus.finops.org/use-cases/](https://focus.finops.org/use-cases/). Developed by FinOps practitioners, these use cases are organized by persona and capability, making it easy to find relevant scenarios. Each use case includes sample SQL queries to help you get started with implementation.
