# Data Generator Metadata

## Scenario

Acme provides metadata about the data generator as a part of their FOCUS data export. They provide the relevant data via the [Data Generator](#datagenerator) schema object.

## Supplied Metadata

Metadata can be provided at a location such as `/FOCUS/metadata/data_generator.json`.

The updated data generator related metadata could look like this:

```json
{
    "DataGenerator": "Acme"
}
```
