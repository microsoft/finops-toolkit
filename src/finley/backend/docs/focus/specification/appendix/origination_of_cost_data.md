# Origination of Cost Data

Cost data presented in the billing datasets originates from various sources depending on the purchasing mechanism. There are at least 3 different pieces of information that are important for understanding where cost originated from.

* [Provider](#provider): The entity that made the [*resources*](#glossary:resource) or [*services*](#glossary:service) available for purchase.
* [Publisher](#publisher): The entity that produced the *resources* or *services* that were purchased.
* [Invoice Issuer](#invoiceissuer): The entity responsible for invoicing for the *resources* or *services* consumed.

The value for each of these may be different depending on the various purchasing scenarios for *resources* or *services*. Use cases for purchasing direct, via a Managed Service Provider (MSP), via a cloud marketplace, and from internal service offerings were considered. The table below presents a few scenarios to show how the value for each dimension may change based on the purchasing scenario.
