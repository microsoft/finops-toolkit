## üìã Prerequisites

Power BI reports use [Tabular Model Definition Language (TMDL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-dataset#tmdl-format), which is currently a preview. Before you can open reports, you will need to enable the **** preview.

1. Open Power BI
2. Select **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options** > **Global** > **Preview features**
3. Enable the following features:
   1. Power BI Project (.pbip) save option
   2. Store semantic model using TMDL format
4. **DO NOT** enable the "Store reports using enhanced metadata format (PBIR)"
5. Select the **OK** button to save settings
6. Restart Power BI

## üìê Design guidelines

Power BI reports in the FinOps toolkit must adhere to the following guidelines:

1. Each report should have a targeted audience and purpose. For example:
   1. Designed for a specific [FinOps persona](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/finops/overview-finops#stakeholders).
   2. Focused on a specific [FinOps capability](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/finops/overview-finops#capabilities).
   3. Built for a specific segment with unique needs (e.g., Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners).
2. Each report should be saved using the Power BI Project (PBIP) format.
3. **Get started** page must be first and follow the standard get started layout. (Copy from the Cost summary report.)
   1. Standard header with "FinOps toolkit" branding, big bold report name, and small version.
   2. Date-based version (`yy.MM.dd`) showing when it was last updated (e.g., `23.10.13` for Oct 13, 2023).
   3. Description of what the report is for with the report name in bold blue (e.g., "The **Foo report** provides...").
   4. Learn more link below the description that points to `https://aka.ms/finops/toolkit/<report-name>` (name in lowercase, spaces replaced with hyphens).
   5. Info icon in the top-right pointing to the same aka.ms link.
   6. Standard additional info section with How to connect your data, About FinOps toolkit, and Need help sections.
   7. Standard image in the bottom-right corner.
4. Every report page should use the standard report layout.
   1. Standard header with blue background, left-aligned report name in bold white text, and the info icon that links to the documentation.
   2. Info icon in the top-right should link to `https://aka.ms/finops/toolkit/<report-name>#<page-name>` (names in lowercase, spaces replaced with hyphens).
   3. Filter row should use the standard layout on all report pages (where applicable).
      1. Date range should be first and left aligned.
      2. All other filters should be left aligned after the date range.
      3. Currency should be last and right-aligned.
      4. Try to use the same filters on all pages, but don't include filters on pages where they aren't applicable.
      5. All filters should be synced across pages.
      6. Filter row is not required on pages with a dashboard layout.
   4. Chart/table pages should use the standard KPI/chart/table layout.
      1. If a chart is not applicable, use the space for the table.
      2. If the table is not applicable, use the space for the chart.
      3. If multiple charts are needed, try to use the chart row for all charts.
      4. If multiple tables are needed, try to use the table row for all tables.
   5. Dashboard pages are more free form and can be organized as needed as long as they feel consistent with the rest of the report.
5. If there is a **Summary** page, it should be the first page after the **Get started** page.
6. All data sources should use the standard folders in the query editor (Transform data).
   1. Configuration settings should be in the **üõ†Ô∏è Setup** folder.
      1. Settings should be grouped into folders by data source (e.g., CM connector, FinOps hubs).
      2. Include a **‚ñ∂Ô∏è START HERE** table with setup instructions. (Copy from the Cost summary report.)
      3. Include a **Data Source** property to indicate which data source should be used.
   2. Queries should all be a the root **FinOps toolkit** folder.
      1. All queries should use the same settings. Do not duplicate properties that can be shared.
7. All text (including report, page, and column names) should follow the [content guidelines](../../docs-wiki/Coding-guidelines.md#-content-strings-and-microcopy).

> [!NOTE]
> Remember: These are general rules of thumb for consistency. They are not set in stone. Please propose updates by submitting a PR, starting a discussion, or creating an issue. In general, use your best judgement to make the report as useful as possible. We just want everything to feel consistent and familiar.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Cost Management template app

The Cost Management template app is managed by the Cost Management team. The template app is not available for download and cannot be edited. We are including this report in the FinOps toolkit to help unblock customers who are looking for something specific in this report, however we highly recommend using the FinOps toolkit reports instead.

The template app is maintained in Azure DevOps at `https://{organization}.visualstudio.com/One/_git/AI-AzureCIP?path=/src/ccm/PBIConnector`.
