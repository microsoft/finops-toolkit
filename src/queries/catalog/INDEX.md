## Adding Queries to the Catalog

When adding queries to the catalog, always follow these steps:

1. **Check Query Catalog first:** Always check this catalog to see if an equivalent query already exists before writing a new one.
2. **Repurpose if possible:** Only add a new query if an existing one cannot be repurposed or parameterized to meet your needs.
3. **Read the Database Documentation:** Review the [FinOps Hub Database Documentation](../finops-hub-database-guide.md) for the latest schema, best practices, and enrichment columns.
4. **Prefer parameterized, top-N queries:** Use `top N`, `last N`, or similar parameters to keep queries flexible and efficient.
5. **Parameterize all inputs:** Avoid hardcoding valuesâ€”use parameters for dates, counts, etc.
6. **Test your query before submission:** Run your query in the FinOps Hub environment and verify the results. Only submit queries that have been tested and validated.
7. **Document and save:** Save the query as a `.kql` file in this folder. Include a header with the query name, description, author, parameters, and last tested date.
8. **Use schema-compliant output names:** All output variable names must comply with the [FinOps Hub database schema](../../src/queries/finops-hub-database-guide.md) for downstream compatibility. Avoid introducing new variable names unless absolutely necessary.
9. **Catalog the query:** If the query works and is documented, add a new entry to the table below. Hyperlink the query name to the `.kql` file and provide a clear description, parameters, and usage notes.

## Catalog of Queries

> **Note:** The table below is sorted alphabetically by query name for ease of use. Please keep this table in alphabetical order when adding new queries.
