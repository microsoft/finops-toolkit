Benefits include enhanced privacy by removing or replacing Protected Health Information (PHI) with realistic synthetic data, maintaining clinical relevance by preserving gender and shifting all dates consistently, and offering efficient processing with synchronous (real-time) or asynchronous (batch) API calls. The service is ideal for healthcare organizations looking to unlock the power of their data for research, analysis, or sharing while adhering to privacy regulations.
