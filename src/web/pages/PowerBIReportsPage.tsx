            <h2>üìà Available Reports</h2>
            <p>
                The FinOps Toolkit includes two sets of reports that connect to different data sources. We recommend using reports connected to Cost Management exports or FinOps Hubs:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="./cost-summary.md">Cost Summary</a> ‚Äì Overview of amortized costs with common breakdowns.

            </ul>
            <p>
                The following reports use the Cost Management connector for Power BI, though it is not recommended for future use:
            </p>
            <ul>

                    <a href="./connector.md">Cost Management Connector</a> ‚Äì Summarizes costs, savings, and commitment discounts for EA and MCA accounts.

            <h2>‚öñÔ∏è Help Me Choose</h2>
            <p>
                Microsoft offers several ways to analyze and report on your cloud costs. Depending on your needs and data size, you can use the Cost Management connector, raw exports, or FinOps Hubs for more advanced capabilities. Here's a guide to help you choose the right solution:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Use the Cost Management connector for data under $2-5M/month.</li>
                <li>For larger datasets or more advanced features, use FinOps Hubs with Power BI.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>‚ú® Connect to Your Data</h2>
            <p>
                All reports come with sample data to explore without needing to connect to your own data. Follow the in-built tutorials to connect to your data:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click **Transform data** in the Power BI toolbar.</li>
