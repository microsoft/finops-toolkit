# ðŸ“’ Azure Optimization Engine reports

This folder contains the several AOE reports that leverage the collected data and generated recommendations. The [workbooks](./workbooks/) folder contains a diverse set of Azure Monitor Workbooks reports, ranging from Azure commitment analysis, optimization recommendations, to Azure Policy compliance or resources inventory over time. All the Workbooks depend on the data generated by AOE and cannot be used independently.

The [Power BI](./AzureOptimizationEngine.pbix) report focuses exclusively on AOE optimization recommendations analysis and is capable to provide some deeper insights around Virtual Machine right-size Cost recommendations and gives also an historical perspective of each recommendation. To use this Power BI report, you just have to download it and configure its data source to point to the AOE SQL Database. The data refresh and transformation query used in this report is reflected in the [powerbi-query.m](./powerbi-query.m) file. You should always update this file after contributing with changes in the report's transformation query.
