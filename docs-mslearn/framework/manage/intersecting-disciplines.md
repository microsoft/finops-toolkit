# FinOps and intersecting frameworks

This article helps you understand the FinOps and intersecting frameworks capability within the FinOps Framework and how to implement that in the Microsoft Cloud.

## Definition

**FinOps and intersecting frameworks refers to integrating FinOps practices with other frameworks and methodologies used by an organization.**

Identify what frameworks and methodologies are used within your organization. Learn about the processes and benefits each framework provides and how they overlap with FinOps. Develop a plan for how processes can be aligned to achieve collective goals.
