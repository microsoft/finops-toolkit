# FinOps and intersecting frameworks

This article helps you understand the FinOps and intersecting frameworks capability within the FinOps Framework and how to implement that in the Microsoft Cloud.

<br>

## Definition

**FinOps and intersecting frameworks refers to integrating FinOps practices with other frameworks and methodologies used by an organization.**

Identify what frameworks and methodologies are used within your organization. Learn about the processes and benefits each framework provides and how they overlap with FinOps. Develop a plan for how processes can be aligned to achieve collective goals.

## Getting started

Implementation of this capability is highly dependent on how your organization adopted each of the following frameworks and methodologies and what tools you use for each. See the following articles for details:

- [IT Asset Management (ITAM)](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/finops-itam/) by FinOps Foundation
- IT Service Management

  - [Azure DevOps and ServiceNow](/azure/devops/pipelines/release/approvals/servicenow)
