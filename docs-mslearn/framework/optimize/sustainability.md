# Cloud sustainability

This article helps you understand the cloud sustainability capability within the FinOps Framework and how to implement that in the Microsoft Cloud.

<br>

## Definition

**Cloud sustainability balances environmental and financial efficiency in cloud optimization, ensuring alignment with strategic objectives.**

To optimize cloud sustainability while balancing cost, establish policies, guidelines, and strategies. Identify opportunities to improve and foster stakeholder engagement for effective evaluation.

<br>

## Getting started

When you first start with cloud sustainability, you use the native tools to drive efficiency and optimize carbon in the portal.

- Use [Azure Carbon Optimization](/azure/carbon-optimization/overview) to find opportunities to lower carbon emissions.
- Consider using the [Cost optimization workbook](../../toolkit/optimization-workbook/cost-optimization-workbook.md) to view carbon optimization recommendations alongside other usage and cost efficiency recommendations. 
<br>

## Building on the basics

At this point, you implemented all the basic carbon optimization recommendations and tuned applications to meet the most fundamental best practices. As you move beyond the basics, consider the following points:

- Expand visibility to business and finance stakeholders by using the [Emissions Impact Dashboard for Azure](/power-bi/connect-data/service-connect-to-emissions-impact-dashboard) or the [Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft 365](/power-bi/connect-data/service-connect-to-emissions-impact-dashboard).
- Explore other tools available in Microsoft's environmental, social, and governance (ESG) capabilities available from the [Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability](/industry/sustainability/overview).
  - For a more prescriptive approach, refer to the [Well-Architected guide for sustainability](/industry/well-architected/sustainability).

## Learn more at the FinOps Foundation

This capability is a part of the FinOps Framework by the FinOps Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing cloud cost management and optimization. For more information about FinOps, including useful playbooks, training and certification programs, and more, see the [Cloud sustainability](https://www.finops.org/framework/capabilities/cloud-sustainability/) article in the FinOps Framework documentation.
