## Examples

### Create one time export

```powershell
New-FinopsCostExport -Name 'July2023OneTime' `
    -Scope "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e" `
    -StorageAccountId "/subscriptions/aaaa0a0a-bb1b-cc2c-dd3d-eeeeee4e4e4e/resourceGroups/SharedStorage/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/ddsharedstorage" `
    -DataSet ActualCost `
    -OneTime `
    -StartDate "2023-07-01" `
    -EndDate "2023-07-31"
```

Creates a new one time export called 'July2023OneTime' from **2023-07-01** to **2023-07-31** with Dataset = Actual and execute it once.

### Create and run a daily export

```powershell
