# FinOps toolkit PowerShell module

The FinOps toolkit PowerShell module is a collection of commands to automate and manage FinOps solutions. We're just getting started so let us know what you'd like to see next. For details about the FinOps toolkit PowerShell module, refer to the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/FinOpsToolkit).

## Install the module

The FinOps toolkit module requires PowerShell 7, which is built into [Azure Cloud Shell](https://portal.azure.com/#cloudshell) and supported on all major operating systems. 

Azure Cloud Shell comes with PowerShell 7 and Azure PowerShell preinstalled. If you aren't using Azure Cloud Shell, you need to [Install PowerShell](/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell) first and then run the following commands to install Azure PowerShell:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts
Install-Module -Name Az.Resources
```

To install the FinOps toolkit module, run the following command in either Azure Cloud Shell or a PowerShell client:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name FinOpsToolkit
```

If it's the first time using Azure PowerShell, you also need to sign into your account and select a default subscription:

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount
```

It shows a popup window to sign in to your account. If you don't see the window, it might be on a different screen.
