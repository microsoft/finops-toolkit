Power BI reports are provided as template (.PBIT) files. Template files are not preconfigured and do not include sample data. When you first open a Power BI template, you will be prompted to specify report parameters, then authenticate with each data source to view your data. To access visuals and queries without loading data, select Edit in the Load menu button.

This article contains images showing example data. Any price data is for test purposes only.

## Working with this report

This report includes the following filters on each page:

- Charge period (date range)
- Subscription and resource group
- Region
- Commitment (for example, reservation and savings plan)
- Service (for example, Virtual machines and SQL database)
- Currency

A few common KPIs you fill find in this report are:

- **Effective cost** shows the effective cost for the period with reservation purchases amortized across the commitment term.
- **Total savings** shows how much you're saving compared to list prices.

The currency must be single-select to ensure costs in different currencies aren't mixed.
