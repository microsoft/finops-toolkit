# Cost Management template app for Enterprise Agreement accounts

The **EA template app** is the .pbix version of the "Cost Management app" in Microsoft AppSource. The template app isn't customizable or downloadable, so we're making the PBIX file available here. We don't recommend using this report as it only works for Enterprise Agreement billing accounts and is no longer being updated. You're welcome to download and customize it as needed. However, you might want to check out the other [FinOps toolkit reports](reports.md), which were updated to cover new scenarios. The [Cost summary](cost-summary.md) and [Rate optimization](rate-optimization.md) reports were both created based on the template app, so you should find most capabilities within those reports. If you feel something is missing, [let us know](https://aka.ms/ftk/ideas)!

## What's changed

In general, we don't plan to make changes to the template app. The following minor updates were made to resolve bugs:

- Added `Tags` and `TagsAsJson` columns to both the **Usage details** and **Usage details amortized** tables.
