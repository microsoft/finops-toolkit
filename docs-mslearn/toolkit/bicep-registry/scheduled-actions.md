# Cost Management scheduled action bicep modules

This article describes the Cost Management scheduled actions Bicep Registry modules that help you send an email on a schedule or when an anomaly is detected.

Scheduled actions allow you to configure email alerts on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Scheduled actions are configured based on a Cost Management view, which can be opened and edited in Cost analysis in the Azure portal. Email alerts include a picture of the selected view and optionally a link to a CSV file with the summarized cost data. You can also use scheduled actions to configure anomaly detection alerts for subscriptions.

To learn about scheduled alerts, see [Save and share views](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/save-share-views#subscribe-to-scheduled-alerts). To learn about anomaly alerts, see [Analyze unexpected charges](/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/analyze-unexpected-charges).
