# Customize Azure optimization engine

The Azure optimization engine (AOE) is a set of Azure Automation runbooks that collect, ingest, and analyze Azure consumption and performance data to provide cost optimization recommendations. The engine is designed to be flexible and customizable, allowing you to adjust its behavior to better fit your organization's needs. This article provides guidance on how to customize the engine's settings. It includes adjusting thresholds, changing schedules, and expanding the engine's scope.

## Widen the engine scope

By default, the Azure Automation Managed Identity is assigned the Reader role only over the respective subscription. However, you can widen the scope of its recommendations just by granting the same Reader role to other subscriptions or, even simpler, to a top-level Management Group.

In the context of augmented virtual machine (VM) right-size recommendations, you might have your VMs reporting to multiple workspaces. If you need to include other workspaces - besides the main one AOE is using - in the recommendations scope, you just have to add their workspace IDs to the `AzureOptimization_RightSizeAdditionalPerfWorkspaces` variable (see more details in [Configuring workspaces](configure-workspaces.md)).

If you have multiple Entra ID directories (also known as tenants), you can extend the reach of AOE to a tenant other than the one where it was deployed. To achieve this, you have two options, each with its pros and cons:

### Multitenant with service principal in secondary tenant

To widen the engine scope using the service principal-based approach, you must ensure the following pre-requisites:

- Create a service principal (App registration) and a secret in the secondary tenant.
- Grant the required permissions to the service principal in the secondary tenant, namely **Reader** in Azure subscriptions/management groups and **Global Reader** in Microsoft Entra ID.
- Create an [Automation credential](/azure/automation/shared-resources/credentials?tabs=azure-powershell#create-a-new-credential-asset) in the AOE's Automation Account. Set the service principal's client ID as username and the secret as password.
- Execute the `Register-MultitenantAutomationSchedules.ps1` script (available in the [AOE root folder](https://aka.ms/AzureOptimizationEngine/code)) in the context of the subscription where AOE was deployed. This script  creates new job schedules for each of the export runbooks and configures them to query the secondary tenant. You just have to call the script using the following syntax:

```powershell
./Register-MultitenantAutomationSchedules.ps1 -AutomationAccountName <AOE automation account> -ResourceGroupName <AOE resource group> -TargetSchedulesSuffix <suffix to append to every new job schedules, e.g., Tenant2> -TargetTenantId <secondary tenant GUID> -TargetTenantCredentialName <name of the Automation credential created in the previous step> [-TargetSchedulesOffsetMinutes <offset in minutes relative to original schedules, defaults to 0>] [-TargetAzureEnvironment <AzureUSGovernment|AzureGermanCloud|AzureCloud>] [-ExcludedRunbooks <An array of runbook names to exclude from the process>] [-IncludedRunbooks <An array of runbook names to include in the process>]
```

### Multitenant with Azure Lighthouse

To widen the engine scope using the Azure Lighthouse-based approach, you must ensure the following pre-requisites:

- Prepare the Azure Resource Manager template to be deployed in the secondary tenant. You can reuse as-is the reference template in our repository (`lighthouse-template.json` file available in the [AOE root folder](https://aka.ms/AzureOptimizationEngine/code)).
- If you're deploying the template for a single subscription, you just have to follow the steps described [here](/azure/lighthouse/how-to/onboard-customer#deploy-the-azure-resource-manager-template), by using the reference template above and specifying the template parameters values (as a separate parameters file or directly in the Azure portal interface).
- If you need to deploy at scale to multiple subscriptions, you can leverage Azure Policy, by following the instructions available [here](/azure/lighthouse/how-to/onboard-management-group) and adjusting the policy definition code to follow the reference template above.
- No matter the deployment approach, the template parameters you must provide are the following:
  - `managedByTenantId` - Microsoft Entra tenant ID of the tenant where AOE was deployed in.
  - `principalId` - Microsoft Entra object ID of the AOE automation account system managed identity.
  - `principalIdDisplayName` - AOE automation account name.

<br>

## Adjust schedules

By default, the base time for the AOE Automation schedules is set as the deployment time. Soon after the initial deployment completes, the exports, ingests, and recommendations runbooks run according to the engine's default schedules. For example, if you deploy AOE on a Monday at 11:00 a.m., you get new recommendations every Monday at 2:30 p.m.. If this schedule, for some reason, doesn't fit your needs, you can reset it to the time that better suits you, by using the `Reset-AutomationSchedules.ps1` script (available in the [AOE root folder](https://aka.ms/AzureOptimizationEngine/code)). You just have to call the following script. Follow the syntax and answer the input requests:

```powershell
./Reset-AutomationSchedules.ps1 -AutomationAccountName <AOE automation account> -ResourceGroupName <AOE resource group> [-AzureEnvironment <AzureUSGovernment|AzureGermanCloud|AzureCloud>]
```

The base time you choose must be in UTC and must be defined according to the day of the week and hour you want recommendations to be generated. You must deduce 3h30m from the time you choose. It's because the base time defines the schedules for all the dependent automation runbooks that must run before the recommendations are generated. For example, let's say you want recommendations to be generated every Monday at 8h30 a.m.; the base time is the next calendar date falling on a Monday, at 5h00 AM. The format of the date you choose must be YYYY-MM-dd HH:mm:ss, for example, `2022-01-03 05:00:00`.

The script also asks you to enter, **if needed**, the Hybrid Worker Group you want the runbooks to run in (see the next subsection).

<br>

## Scale AOE runbooks with Hybrid Worker

By default, AOE Automation runbooks are executed in the context of the Azure Automation sandbox. You might face performance issues due to the memory limits of the Automation sandbox. Or, you might decide to implement private endpoints for the Storage Account or SQL Database to harden AOE's security. In either case, you need to execute runbooks from a Hybrid Worker. It’s an Azure or on-premises Virtual Machine with the Automation Hybrid Worker extension. To change the execution context for the AOE runbooks, you must use the `Reset-AutomationSchedules.ps1` script. See how to use the script in the previous subsection. After setting the runbooks execution base time, enter the Hybrid Worker Group name you want the runbooks to run in.

<!-- cSpell:ignore UAMI, Mbps -->
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The Hybrid Worker machine must have the required PowerShell modules installed. The `upgrade-manifest.json` file contains the list of required modules.
> - Once you change the runbook execution context to Hybrid Worker, you must always use the `DoPartialUpgrade` flag whenever you upgrade AOE, or else you lose the runbook schedule settings and revert to the default sandbox configuration.
> - The Managed Identity used to authenticate against Azure, Microsoft Entra ID, and Billing Account scopes is still the one Azure Automation uses. It gets used even if the Hybrid Worker machine has a Managed Identity assigned ([see details](/azure/automation/automation-hrw-run-runbooks?#runbook-auth-managed-identities)). User-assigned Managed Identities are supported in the context of Hybrid Workers only if:
>   - The Automation Account doesn't have any associated Managed Identity, that is, only the Hybrid Worker machine can have a User-Assigned Managed Identity.
>   - All runbooks run in the context of the Hybrid Worker. In this case, you must create an `AzureOptimization_UAMIClientID` Automation Variable with the User-Assigned Managed Identity Client ID as value.
>   - The `AzureOptimization_AuthenticationOption` Automation variable value is updated to `UserAssignedManagedIdentity`.

## Adjust thresholds

For Advisor cost recommendations, the AOE's default configuration produces percentile 99th VM metrics aggregations, but you can adjust them to be less conservative. There are also adjustable metrics thresholds that are used to compute the fit score. The default thresholds values are 30% for CPU (5% for shutdown recommendations), 50% for memory (100% for shutdown) and 750 Mbps for network bandwidth (10 Mbps for shutdown). All the adjustable configurations are available as Azure Automation variables. The information in the next table highlights the most relevant configuration variables. To access them, go to the Automation Account _Shared Resources - Variables_ menu option.
