## v0.7

_Released December 1, 2024_

### FinOps guide v0.7

- **Changed**
  - Added Enterprise App Patterns links resources to the [Architecting for cloud capability](../framework/optimize/architecting.md).
  - Update cost and unit of measure handling in the [FOCUS conversion instructions](../focus/convert.md).

### Power BI reports v0.7

- **Added**
  - Added partial support for OneLake URLs.
    - Support for OneLake URLs was added based on feedback and wasn't fully tested. More changes may be needed to fully support Microsoft Fabric.
  - Fix EffectiveCost for savings plan purchases to work around a bug in exported data.
  - Added KQL-based version of the [Cost summary](power-bi/cost-summary.md), [Data ingestion](power-bi/data-ingestion.md), and [Rate optimization](power-bi/rate-optimization.md) reports that connect to FinOps hubs with Azure Data Explorer.
- **Changed**
  - Consolidated the **Hub Storage URL** and **Export Storage URL** parameters into a single **Storage URL**.
    - All datasets must be either raw exports outside of FinOps hubs or be processed through hubs. This release no longer supports some data from hubs and some from raw exports.
    - If you have existing exports that aren't running through hubs data pipelines, change the exports to point to the hub **msexports** container.
    - This change was made to simplify the setup process and avoid errors in Power BI service configuration (for example, incremental refresh).
  - Renamed the following columns:
    - The **x_DatasetChanges** column is now **x_SourceChanges**.
    - The **x_DatasetType** column is now **x_SourceType**.
    - The **x_DatasetVersion** column is now **x_SourceVersion**.
    - The **x_AccountType** column is now **x_BillingAccountAgreement**.
  - Updated supported spend estimates in the Power BI documentation.

### FinOps hubs v0.7

_**Breaking change**_

- **Added**
  - Option to ingest data into an Azure Data Explorer cluster.
  - Set missing reservation list and contracted prices/cost columns for EA and MCA accounts (Data Explorer only).
    - Requires the price sheet export to be configured.
  - Support for FOCUS 1.0r2 exports.
    - The 1.0r2 dataset only differs in date formatting. There are no functional differences compared to 1.0.
    - For example, dates in 1.0 are formatted as `2024-01-01T00:00Z` while dates in 1.0r2 are formatted as `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`. Note the last `:00` for seconds.
    - The 1.0r2 dataset is only needed if you experience date parsing errors with the 1.0 dataset.
  - Support for private endpoints via an optional template parameter.
    - Added private endpoints for storage account, Azure Data Explorer & Keyvault.
    - Added managed virtual network & storage endpoint for Azure Data Factory Runtime.
    - All data processing now happens within a virtual network.
    - Added param to disable external access to Azure Data Lake and Azure Data Explorer.
    - Added param to specify subnet range of virtual network - minimum size = /26
  - Support for storage account infrastructure encryption.
  - Published a [schema file](https://aka.ms/finops/hubs/settings-schema) for the hub settings.json file.
- **Changed**
  - Changed dataset names in the ingestion container to facilitate Azure Data Explorer ingestion.
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This change requires removing previously ingested data for the current month to avoid data duplication. You do not need to re-export historical data for storage-based Power BI reports; however, historical data DOES need to be re-exported to ingest into Azure Data Explorer.
    - For FOCUS cost data, use `Costs`.
    - For price sheet data, use `Prices`.
    - For reservation details, use `CommitmentDiscountUsage`.
    - For reservation recommendations, use `Recommendations`.
    - For reservation transactions, use `Transactions`.
  - Renamed the `msexports_FileAdded` trigger to `msexports_ManifestAdded`.
- **Fixed**
  - Fix EffectiveCost for savings plan purchases to work around a bug in exported data (Data Explorer only).

### FinOps workbooks v0.7

#### [Optimization workbook v0.7](workbooks/optimization.md)

- **Added**
  - On the Storage tab, included the **RSVaultBackup** tag in the list of nonidle disks.

  - On the Compute tab, fixed incorrect virtual machine processor in processors query.
- **Removed**
  - On the Database tab, removed the idle SQL databases query.
    - This query will be reevaluated and added again in a future release.

## v0.5 Update 1

_Released September 7, 2024_

This release is a minor patch to Power BI files. These files were updated in the existing 0.5 release. We're documenting the release as a new patch release for transparency.

### Power BI reports v0.5 update 1

- **Fixed**
  - Corrected a bug where Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) data sources couldn't be refreshed from the Power BI service ([#964](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/issues/964)).

<br>

## v0.5

_Released September 1, 2024_

### FinOps guide v0.5

- **Added**
  - Documented [how to compare FOCUS and actual/amortized data](../focus/validate.md) to learn and validate FOCUS data.

### Power BI reports v0.5

#### General Power BI updates v0.5

- **Changed**
  - Updated `ListCost`, `ListUnitPrice`, `ContractedCost`, and `ContractedUnitPrice` when not provided in Cost Management exports.
    - Contracted cost/price are set to effective cost/price when not available.
    - List cost/price are set to contracted cost/price when not available.
    - This means savings can be calculated, but aren't complete.
    - Refer to the Data quality page for details about missing or updated data.
  - Added support for pointing Power BI reports directly to Cost Management exports (without FinOps hubs).
  - Added new tables for Prices, ReservationDetails, ReservationRecommendations, and ReservationTransactions (works with exports only; doesn't work with hubs).
- **Fixed**
  - Fixed a bug in Cost Management exports where committed usage is showing as "Standard" pricing category.

#### [Cost summary report v0.5](power-bi/cost-summary.md)

- **Changed**
  - Added a table to the [Data quality page](power-bi/cost-summary.md#data-quality) to identify rows for which a unique ID can't be identified.
  - Added a table to the [Data quality page](power-bi/cost-summary.md#data-quality) to identify rows where billing currency and pricing currency are different.

#### [Rate optimization report v0.5](power-bi/rate-optimization.md)

- **Changed**
  - Commitment savings no longer filters out rows with missing list/contracted cost.
    - Since `ListCost` and `ContractedCost` are set to a fallback value when not included in Cost Management data, we can now calculate partial savings.
    - The calculated savings function is still incomplete since we don't have accurate list/contracted cost values.
  - Merged shared and single reservation recommendations into a single [Reservation recommendations](power-bi/rate-optimization.md#reservation-recommendations) page.

### FinOps hubs v0.5

- **Added**
  - Added an optional `skipEventGridRegistration` template parameter to support skipping Event Grid resource provider registration.
  - Added an Event Grid section to the hubs create form.

  - Changed the Event Grid location selection logic to only identify fallback regions rather than supported regions.
  - Expanded cost estimate documentation to call out Power BI pricing and include a link to the Pricing Calculator.
- **Fixed**
  - Updated the config_ConfigureExports pipeline to handle when scopes in the settings.json file aren't an object.
  - Fixed a bug where scopes added via the Add-FinOpsHubScope command aren't added correctly due to missing brackets.

### FinOps workbooks v0.5

#### [Optimization workbook v0.5](workbooks/optimization.md)

- **Added**
  - New compute query to identify VMs per processor architecture type

  - `Register-MultitenantAutomationSchedules` PowerShell script helper to [add a different Azure tenant to the scope of AOE](optimization-engine/customize.md).
  - Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) disks included in the scope of the `Premium SSD disk has been underutilized` recommendation (besides locally redundant storage (LRS)).
  - Option to scope consumption exports to MCA Billing Profile.
- **Changed**
  - Improved SQL Database security, replacing SQL authentication by Microsoft Entra ID authentication-only.
- **Fixed**
  - `Premium SSD disk has been underutilized` recommendation wasn't showing results due to a meter name change in Cost Management ([#831](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/issues/831)).
  - Consumption exports for pay-as-you-go MCA subscriptions were missing cost data ([#828](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/issues/828))

- **Fixed**
  - Fixed [New-FinOpsCostExport](powershell/cost/New-FinOpsCostExport.md) to address breaking change in Cost Management when storage paths start with `/`.
  - Fixed a bug where scopes added via the Add-FinOpsHubScope command aren't added correctly due to missing brackets.
