# FinOps toolkit contribution guide

Welcome to the FinOps toolkit. As an open-source initiative, our success hinges on the collective effort of the community. Your contributions play a vital role in enhancing and expanding the toolkit's capabilities, making it more valuable and effective for everyone.

There are several ways you can contribute to the FinOps toolkit:

- **Work on existing bugs:** You can assist by identifying and addressing existing bugs listed in our repository. 
- **Provide suggestions for new features or improvements:** If you're not comfortable with coding, you can still contribute by suggesting new features or improvements for our tools.
- **Propose a new tool:** If you developed a FinOps-related tool and want it to be part of the FinOps toolkit, you can submit a proposal for consideration.
- **Review pull requests:** Code reviews are a critical aspect of maintaining code quality and ensuring the reliability and functionality of the project. By reviewing existing pull requests (PRs) suggested by community members, you can contribute significantly to the project's success without necessarily creating new code.
- **Answer questions:** Being actively involved in answering questions and providing assistance to community members is an invaluable contribution to the project.
- **Update documentation:** Documentation serves as a crucial resource for users, developers, and contributors alike. We strive to keep documentation accurate, comprehensive, and up to date. It's essential for the success of the toolkit.

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the FinOps toolkit!

Ensure that the code adheres to our [coding guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/wiki/Coding-guidelines), is well-documented, and follows best practices.

Offer suggestions for improving the quality of the code, such as optimizing performance, enhancing readability, and addressing potential edge cases or bugs.

To ensure they work as intended, test the functionality of the code changes proposed in the PR. It involves running tests, verifying edge cases, and checking for any unintended side effects.

When possible, try to suggest code changes using **Add a suggestion** to streamline the review process.
