Most of the columns in FinOps toolkit solutions originate in Cost Management or the FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS). The following information is a list of all columns you can expect to see in our solutions. For simplicity, the data dictionary doesn't include the `x_` prefix used to denote "external" or non-FOCUS columns, so `x_AccountName` is listed under `AccountName`.

## Generating a unique ID

To generate a unique ID, use the following columns in the Cost Management FOCUS dataset:

1. BillingAccountId
2. ChargePeriodStart
3. CommitmentDiscountId
4. RegionId
5. ResourceId
6. ResourceName
7. SkuPriceId
8. SubAccountId
9. Tags
10. x_AccountOwnerId
11. x_CostCenter
12. x_InvoiceSectionId
13. x_ResourceGroupName
14. x_SkuDetails
15. x_SkuMeterId
16. x_SkuOfferId
17. x_SkuPartNumber

<br>

## Known issues

- Price and cost columns can be 0 when the data isn't available in Cost Management. They include, but might not be limited to:
   - `ListCost`
   - `ListUnitPrice`
   - `x_ListCostInUsd`
   - `ContractedCost`
   - `ContractedUnitPrice`
   - `EffectiveCost`
   - `x_EffectiveUnitPrice`
- Price and cost savings might be incomplete if not specified in Cost Management.
- For the Cost Management connector, `PricingUnit` and `UsageUnit` both include the pricing block size. Exports (and FinOps hubs) separate the block size into `x_PricingBlockSize`.
- For the Cost Management connector, `SkuPriceId` isn't set due to the connector not having the data to populate the value.

> [!NOTE]
> If you notice any oddities in historical cost data obtained via Cost Management exports (including FinOps hubs), re-export cost data for the month in question before filing a support request.
