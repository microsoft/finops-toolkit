# FinOps toolkit data dictionary

This article describes column names found in FinOps toolkit solutions. Most of the columns in FinOps toolkit solutions originate in Cost Management or the FinOps Open Cost and Usage Specification (FOCUS).

<br>

## List of terms

The following table includes columns you can expect to see in FinOps toolkit solutions. For simplicity, the data dictionary doesn't include the `x_` prefix used to denote "external" or non-FOCUS columns, so `x_AccountName` is listed under `AccountName`.
