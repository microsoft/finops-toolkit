# How to get support for the FinOps toolkit

Tools and resources within the FinOps toolkit are provided as-is without any express or implied warranties. Microsoft Support doesn't handle support requests for the FinOps toolkit. However, the underlying products used by tools in the toolkit are officially supported.

> [!NOTE]
> The term "tool" is being used to indicate a software offering. "Products" are tools that are operationally managed by Microsoft. "Solutions" are pre-configured tools that may use a mix of managed products and custom code and are deployed and managed by you (or another organization on your behalf).

If you run into an issue, follow the steps in each of the following sections in order to mitigate and resolve the issue.

<br>

## Report security issues securely

If you believe you found a security vulnerability, refer to [Reporting security issues](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/blob/dev/SECURITY.md).

<br>

## Review instructions

Before you continue, confirm all setup instructions were completed in order. 9 out of 10 issues are due to missing steps. Follow instructions carefully.

<br>

## Follow the troubleshooting guide

Next, walk through the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md). The most common issues and their solutions are documented and should be able to be resolved independently.

<br>

## Identify the source of the issue

For error messages, what product is showing the error? Does the error refer to another product? For missing or incorrect data, is the data generated in Power BI report or does it come directly from a product, like Cost Management?

<br>

## Create support requests for product issues

If the source of the issue is a managed product (including data from Cost Management), create a Microsoft support request for that specific product. If you're not sure, ask in the [Q&A discussion forum](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/discussions/categories/q-a).

<br>

## Create an issue in GitHub

Whether you submit a support request or not, we recommend [creating an issue](https://aka.ms/ftk/ideas) to let us know about the problems you're facing. Even if the issue is a product bug, we would like to document it to help others.

We try to respond to issues and discussions within three business days but there can sometimes be unanticipated delays. If you completed all of the preceding steps and the issue wasn't resolved within a week, join our [biweekly office hours](https://aka.ms/ftk/office-hours) to get live help from the team. If you need more hands-on support, you can request a paid, community-driven advisory session or consulting delivery during the office hours call.
