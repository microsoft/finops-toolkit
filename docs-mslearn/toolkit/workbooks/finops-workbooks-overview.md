# FinOps workbooks

FinOps workbooks are Azure Monitor workbooks that provide a series of tools to help engineers perform targeted FinOps capabilities, modeled after the Well-Architected Framework guidance.

This template includes the following workbooks:

- [Optimization](optimization.md)
- [Governance](governance.md)

<br>

## Deploy the workbooks

1. To deploy and use the workbook, confirm you have the following least-privileged roles:

   - **Workbook Contributor** allows you to deploy the workbook.
   - **Reader** view all of the workbook tabs.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you only have read access, you can still import your workbook directly into Azure Monitor. You will not be able to save it, but you can view all tabs.

2. Deploy the **finops-workbooks** template.
