# Governance workbook

The governance workbook is an Azure Monitor workbook that provides a comprehensive overview of the governance posture of your Azure environment. It includes the standard metrics aligned with the Cloud Adoption Framework for all disciplines and has the capability to identify and apply recommendations to address noncompliant resources.

This article details the tabs and information you find within the workbook.

You can also get general information on subscriptions and resource groups.

<br>

## Cost Management

The **Cost Management** tab shows high level information about your cost and can be filtered by tag.

<br>

## Usage + limits

Many Azure services have quotas, which are the assigned number of resources for your Azure subscription. Each quota represents a specific countable resource, such as:

- The number of virtual machines you can create
- The number of storage accounts you can use concurrently
- The number of networking resources you can consume
- The number of API calls to a particular service you can make

The **Usage & limits** tab shows resource this information about your subscriptions. To learn more about quotas, see [Quotas overview](/azure/quotas/quotas-overview).

<br>

## Compliance

The **Compliance** tab helps you monitor policy compliance, the number of failures by resource, operation, and category.

<br>

## Governance

Microsoft Defender for Cloud continuously assesses your hybrid and multicloud workloads and provides you with recommendations to harden your assets and enhance your security posture.

Central security teams often experience challenges when driving the personnel within their organizations to implement recommendations. The organizations' security posture can suffer as a result.

We're introducing a brand-new, built-in governance experience to set ownership and expected remediation timeframes to resolve recommendations.

Prerequisite: To use this governance report, you need to create security governance rules.

For more information, see [Driving your organization to remediate security issues with recommendation governance in Microsoft Defender for Cloud](/azure/defender-for-cloud/governance-rules).
