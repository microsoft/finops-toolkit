# Configure Data Explorer dashboards

Azure Data Explorer and Microsoft Fabric eventhouses are fast and highly scalable data exploration services. You can explore data in Microsoft Fabric or the [Azure Data Explorer web application](https://dataexplorer.azure.com) by running queries or building dashboards. A dashboard is a collection of queries visualized as tiles and organized into pages. The FinOps toolkit provides a custom dashboard with pages design to facilitate FinOps capabilities. This article walks you through the process of deploying and configuring this dashboard.

This walkthrough does not incur any cost; however, maintaining an active Data Explorer cluster does incur cost.

<br>

## Prerequisites

- [Deployed a FinOps hub instance](finops-hubs-overview.md#create-a-new-hub) with Data Explorer.
- [Configured scopes](configure-scopes.md) and ingested data successfully.
- Database viewer or greater access to the Data Explorer **Hub** and **Ingestion** databases. [Learn more](/kusto/management/manage-database-security-roles#database-level-security-roles).
- Optional: Member or Contributor access to a Microsoft Fabric eventhouse with shortcuts to the FinOps hub **Hub** and **Ingestion** databases. [Learn more](deploy.md#optional-connect-to-microsoft-fabric).

## Deploy the dashboard

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
### [Data Explorer](#tab/data-explorer)

1. Download the [latest dashboard template](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/releases/latest/download/finops-hub-dashboard.json).
2. Copy the Data Explorer cluster URI:
   1. Go to the [list of resource groups](https://portal.azure.com/#browse/resourcegroups) in the Azure portal.
   2. Select the resource group where your FinOps hub instance was deployed.
   3. Select **Settings** > **Deployments** > **hub** > **Outputs**.
   4. Copy the **clusterUri** output value.
3. Create a dashboard from the template:
   1. Go to [Azure Data Explorer dashboards](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/dashboards).
   2. Select the down arrow next to the **New dashboard** button.<br>
      :::image type="content" source="./media/configure-dashboard/new-dashboard-menu.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the new dashboard menu with an Import dashboard from file menu item." lightbox="./media/configure-dashboard/new-dashboard-menu.png" :::
   3. Select the **Import dashboard from file** option.
   4. Browse to and select the **finops-hub-dashboard.json** file from step one.
   5. Specify the desired name and select **Create**.
4. Connect the dashboard to your cluster:
   1. At the top of the page, select **Data sources**.
   2. In the pane on the right, select the pencil under **Hub**.
   3. Paste the **Cluster URI** from step two.
   4. Select the **Connect** button and then select the **Hub** database.
   5. Select **Apply** and then **Close**.

Note that Data Explorer dashboards are only accessible to the person who creates them by default. Access to the data is controlled at the database level, so access to a dashboard does not grant access to the underlying data. Be sure to share access to the dashboard and the **Hub** and **Ingestion** databases in order for people to see the functional dashboard. For details, see [Share the dashboard](#share-the-dashbaord).

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
### [Fabric](#tab/fabric)

1. [Download the dashboard template](https://github.com/microsoft/finops-toolkit/releases/latest/download/finops-hub-dashboard.json).
2. Grant any users **Viewer** (or greater) access to the workspace. [Learn more](/fabric/fundamentals/roles-workspaces).
3. Create a dashboard from the template:
   1. From your Fabric workspace, select the **+ New item** command at the top of the page.
   2. Select **Visualize data** > **Real-time dashboard**.
   3. Specify a name and select **Create**.
   4. Select **Manage** > **Replace with file** at the top of the page.
   5. Select the downloaded file from step one.
4. Connect the dashboard to your cluster:
   1. Select **Manage** > **Data sources** at the top of the page.
   2. In the pane on the right, select the pencil under **Hub**.
   3. Select **Database** > **Eventhouse / KQL database**, then select the **Hub** database and **Connect**.
   4. Select the desired **Data source access permissions**:
      - Recommended: Select **Dashboard editor's identity** to use your identity to access underlying data (so viewers do not need direct access).
      - Select **Pass-through identity** to require dashboard viewers to have access to the underlying data.
   5. Select **Apply**, then **Close**.

You can now explore the FinOps hub dashboard.

## Customize the dashboard

The FinOps hub dashboard is a sample dashboard that is intended to be customized. We encourage you to customize the dashboard to meet specific stakeholder needs and copy queries to other dashboards. To learn more about creating and customizing dashboards, refer to the following articles:

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
### [Data Explorer](#tab/data-explorer)

- [Visualize data with Azure Data Explorer dashboards](/azure/data-explorer/azure-data-explorer-dashboards)
- [Customize dashboard visuals](/azure/data-explorer/dashboard-customize-visuals)
- [Apply conditional formatting](/azure/data-explorer/dashboard-conditional-formatting)

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line -->
### [Fabric](#tab/fabric)

- [Create a real-time dashboard](/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-real-time-create)
- [Customize real-time dashboard visuals](/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-visuals-customize)
- [Apply conditional formatting in real-time dashboards](/fabric/real-time-intelligence/dashboard-conditional-formatting)

---

Note that customized dashboards can't be merged with future releases of the FinOps toolkit from the dashboard editor. If you need to customize the dashboard, consider using Git or another source control solution.

## Grant access to data

Dashboards query data in the **Ingestion** database using functions in the **Hub** database. Due to this, dashboard users must have **Viewer** (or greater) access to both the **Hub** and **Ingestion** databases. Alternatively, users can have **AllDatabasesViewer** access to the entire cluster.

If using a Fabric real-time dashboard with the dashboard editor's identity, you can skip this step.

### [Fabric](#tab/fabric)

Microsoft Fabric manages access at a workspace level. To grant access at a database level, use KQL.

1. Open the workspace in Microsoft Fabric.
2. Select **Manage access** in the top-right corner of the page.
3. Select **+ Add people or groups**.
4. Specify the desired name or email address and select **Add**.

### [Azure portal](#tab/azure-portal)

1. Open the Data Explorer cluster in the Azure portal.
2. In the menu, select **Data** > **Databases**.
3. Select the **Hub** database.
4. In the menu, select **Overview** > **Permissions**.
5. Select the **Add** command, then the desired security role. Viewer is the least-privileged role.
6. Select the desired users, groups, and applications, then select the **Select** button.
7. Repeat steps 3-6 for the **Ingestion** database.

### [KQL](#tab/kql)

The following KQL can be run from the cluster's **Query** page in the Azure portal, from the [Data Explorer portal](https://dataexplorer.azure.com), or from a Microsoft Fabric queryset or PySpark notebook.

```kusto
.add database Hub viewers ('aaduser=<email>', 'aadGroup=<group-id>', 'aadapp=<app-id>;<tenant-id-or-domain>')

.add database Ingestion viewers ('aaduser=<email>', 'aadGroup=<group-id>', 'aadapp=<app-id>;<tenant-id-or-domain>')
```

For additional details, see [Database level security role](/kusto/management/manage-database-security-roles#database-level-security-roles).

## Alternatives to dashboards

While dashboards are free and simple to configure, you may have requirements that necessitate another reporting solution. Some examples might be bringing in data outside of Data Explorer or merging with existing reports used by stakeholders across the organization. We recommend everyone deploy the FinOps hub dashboard, but if you need other options, consider utilizing the [FinOps toolkit Power BI reports](../power-bi/reports.md).

The KQL reports are tuned to take advantage of the performance enhancements offered by Azure Data Explorer. This is the fastest, most scalable option for organizations analyzing over $2 million per month in spend or more than one year of data in Power BI.

You may also consider using [Azure workbooks](/azure/azure-monitor/visualize/workbooks-overview) in the Azure portal or utilizing other tools that support connecting to Azure Data Explorer, like Excel, Grafana, and Tableau. To learn more about these and other tools that support Azure Data Explorer, see [Visualization integrations overview](/azure/data-explorer/integrate-visualize-overview).
