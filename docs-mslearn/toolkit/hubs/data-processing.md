# How data is processed in FinOps hubs

FinOps hubs perform many data processing activities to clean up, normalize, and optimize data. The following sections show how data flows from Cost Management into a hub instance.

<br>

## Scope setup

A **scope** is a level within the cloud resource and account hierarchy that provides access to cost, usage, and carbon data. For FinOps hubs, we typically recommend using Enterprise Agreement (EA) billing accounts or Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) billing profiles, however any cloud scope is sufficient for basic analysis. The main concern is about whether price and reservation data is needed, since Cost Management only exposes the data for EA billing accounts and MCA billing profiles.

FinOps hubs support configuring scopes by manually configuring Cost Management exports or by granting FinOps hubs access to manage scopes on your behalf. Managed scopes are configured in the **config/settings.json** file in hub storage. The information describes what happens when a new, managed scope is added into this file. Unmanaged scopes, where Cost Management exports are manually configured, don't require other setup.

    config->>config: ① config_SettingsUpdated
    config->>config: ② config_ConfigureExports
    config->>Cost Management: ② PUT .../exports/foo
```

<br>
-->

1. The **config_SettingsUpdated** trigger runs when the **settings.json** file is updated.
2. The **config_ConfigureExports** pipeline creates new exports for any new scopes that were added.

<br>

## Data ingestion

Data ingestion can be broken down into two parts:

1. Exports push data to storage.
2. Hubs processes and ingests data.

<!--
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    config->>config: ① config_Daily/MonthlySchedule
    config->>config: ② config_StartExportProcess
    config->>config: ③ config_RunExportJobs
    config->>Cost Management: ③ POST /exports/foo/run
    Cost Management->>msexports: ④ Export data
    msexports->>msexports: ⑤ msexports_ExecuteETL
    msexports->>ingestion: ⑥ msexports_ETL_ingestion
    Power BI-
->>ingestion: ⑦ Read data
```

<br>
-->

For managed scopes, hubs perform the following steps:

1. The **config_DailySchedule** and **config_MonthlySchedule** triggers run on their respective schedules to kick off data ingestion.
2. The **config_StartExportProcess** pipeline gets the applicable exports for the schedule that is running.
3. The **config_RunExportJobs** pipeline executes each of the selected exports.
4. Cost Management exports raw cost details to the **msexports** container. [Learn more](#about-exports).

After exports are run, whether managed or unmanaged, hubs perform the following steps:

1. The **msexports_ExecuteETL** pipeline kicks off the extract-transform-load (ETL) process when files are added to storage.
2. The **msexports_ETL_ingestion** pipeline transforms the data to parquet format and moves it to the **ingestion** container using a scalable file structure. [Learn more](#about-ingestion).
3. Power BI or other tools read data from the **ingestion** container.

<br>

## About ingestion

FinOps hubs rely on a specific folder path in the **ingestion** container:

```text
ingestion/{dataset}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{scope-id}
```

- `ingestion` is the container where the data pipeline saves data.
- `{dataset}` is the exported dataset type.
- `{month}` is the year and month of the exported data formatted as `yyyyMM`.
- `{scope-id}` is expected to be the fully qualified resource ID of the scope the data is from.

If you need to use hubs to monitor non-Azure data, convert the data to [FOCUS](../../focus/what-is-focus.md) and drop it into the **ingestion** container. Note this process wasn't explicitly tested in the latest release. If you experience any issues, [create an issue](https://aka.ms/ftk/ideas).

<br>

## About exports

FinOps hubs use Cost Management exports to obtain cost data. Cost Management controls the folder structure for the exported data in the **msexports** container. A typical path looks like:

```text
{container}/{path}/{date-range}/{export-name}/{export-time}/{guid}/{file}
```

As of 0.4, FinOps hubs don't rely on file paths. Hubs utilize the manifest file to identify the scope, dataset, month, etc. The only important part of the path for hubs is the container, which must be **msexports**.

> [!WARNING]
  > - Don't export data to the **ingestion** container. Exported CSVs **must** be published to the **msexports** container to be processed by the hubs engine.
  > - To ingest custom data, save FOCUS-aligned parquet files in the **ingestion** container for the FinOps toolkit Power BI reports to work as expected.


Export manifests can change with API versions. Here's an example with API version `2023-07-01-preview`:

```json
{
  "exportConfig": {
    "exportName": "<export-name>",
    "resourceId": "/<scope>/providers/Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/<export-name>",
    "dataVersion": "<dataset-version>",
    "apiVersion": "<api-version>",
    "type": "<dataset-type>",
    "timeFrame": "OneTime|TheLastMonth|MonthToDate",
    "granularity": "Daily"
  },
  "deliveryConfig": {
    "partitionData": true,
    "dataOverwriteBehavior": "CreateNewReport|OverwritePreviousReport",
    "fileFormat": "Csv",
    "containerUri": "<storage-resource-id>",
    "rootFolderPath": "<path>"
  },
  "runInfo": {
    "executionType": "Scheduled",
    "submittedTime": "2024-02-03T18:33:03.1032074Z",
    "runId": "af754a8e-30fc-4ef3-bfc6-71bd1efb8598",
    "startDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00",
    "endDate": "2024-01-31T00:00:00"
  },
  "blobs": [
    {
      "blobName": "<path>/<export-name>/<date-range>/<export-time>/<guid>/<file-name>.csv",
      "byteCount": ###
    }
  ]
}
```

FinOps hubs use the following properties:

- `exportConfig.resourceId` to identify the scope.
- `exportConfig.type` to identify the dataset type.
- `exportConfig.dataVersion` to identify the dataset version.
- `runInfo.startDate` to identify the exported month.

<a name="datasets"></a>FinOps hubs support the following dataset types, versions, and API versions:

- FocusCost: `1.0`, `1.0-preview(v1)`
- PriceSheet: `2023-05-01`
- ReservationDetails: `2023-03-01`
- ReservationRecommendations: `2023-05-01`

## FinOps hubs v0.4-0.5

The following information describes how data is processed in FinOps hubs v0.4-0.5.

### Scope setup in v0.4-0.5

1. The **config_SettingsUpdated** trigger runs when the **settings.json** file is updated.
2. The **config_ConfigureExports** pipeline creates new exports for any new scopes that were added.

### Data ingestion in v0.4-0.5

For managed scopes:

1. The **config_DailySchedule** and **config_MonthlySchedule** triggers run on their respective schedules to kick off data ingestion.
2. The **config_ExportData** pipeline gets the applicable exports for the schedule that is running.
3. The **config_RunExports** pipeline executes each of the selected exports.
4. Cost Management exports raw cost details to the **msexports** container. For more information, see [About exports in v04-05](#about-exports-in-v04-05).

After exports are completed, for both managed and unmanaged scopes:

1. The **msexports_ExecuteETL** pipeline kicks off the extract-transform-load (ETL) process when files are added to storage.
2. The **msexports_ETL_ingestion** pipeline transforms the data to a standard schema and saves the raw data in parquet format to the **ingestion** container. For more information, see [About ingestion in v04-05](#about-ingestion-in-v04-05).
3. Power BI reads cost data from the **ingestion** container.

### About ingestion in v0.4-0.5

FinOps hubs rely on a specific folder path in the **ingestion** container:

```text
ingestion/{dataset}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{scope-id}
```

- `ingestion` is the container where the data pipeline saves data.
- `{dataset}` is the exported dataset type.
- `{month}` is the year and month of the exported data formatted as `yyyyMM`.
- `{scope-id}` is expected to be the fully qualified resource ID of the scope the data is from.

If you need to use hubs to monitor non-Azure data, convert the data to [FOCUS](../../focus/what-is-focus.md) and drop it into the **ingestion** container. This process wasn't explicitly tested in the latest release. If you experience any issues, [create an issue](https://aka.ms/ftk/ideas).

### About exports in v0.4-0.5

FinOps hubs use Cost Management exports to obtain cost data. Cost Management controls the folder structure for the exported data in the **msexports** container. A typical path looks like:

```text
{container}/{path}/{date-range}/{export-name}/{export-time}/{guid}/{file}
```

As of 0.4, FinOps hubs don't rely on file paths. Hubs utilize the manifest file to identify the scope, dataset, month, and so on. The only important part of the path for hubs is the container, which must be **msexports**.

> [!NOTE]

Export manifests can change with API versions. Here's an example with API version `2023-07-01-preview`:

```json
{
  "exportConfig": {
    "exportName": "<export-name>",
    "resourceId": "/<scope>/providers/Microsoft.CostManagement/exports/<export-name>",

      "byteCount": ###
    }
  ]
}
```

FinOps hubs use the following properties:

- `exportConfig.resourceId` to identify the scope.
- `exportConfig.type` to identify the dataset type.
- `exportConfig.dataVersion` to identify the dataset version.
- `runInfo.startDate` to identify the exported month.

FinOps hubs support the following dataset types, versions, and API versions:

- FocusCost: `1.0`, `1.0-preview(v1)`
- PriceSheet: `2023-05-01`
- ReservationDetails: `2023-03-01`
- ReservationRecommendations: `2023-05-01`
- ReservationTransactions: `2023-05-01`
- API versions: `2023-07-01-preview`

## FinOps hubs v0.2-0.3

The following steps outline the process for exporting and processing cost data using FinOps hubs versions 0.2-0.3:

1. Cost Management exports raw cost details to the **msexports** container. For more information, see [About exports](#about-exports).
2. The **msexports_ExecuteETL** pipeline kicks off the extract-transform-load (ETL) process when files are added to storage.
3. The **msexports_ETL_ingestion** pipeline saves exported data in parquet format in the **ingestion** container. For more information, see [About exports](#about-ingestion).
4. Power BI reads cost data from the **ingestion** container.

FinOps hubs 0.2-0.3 use the export path to determine the exported scope and month. This point is important as updates to the path can break the data pipelines. To avoid this problem, we recommend updating to FinOps hubs 0.4. The expected path should mimic:

```text
msexports/{scope-id}/{export-name}/{date-range}/{export-time}/{guid}/{file}
```

- `msexports` is the container specified on the export.
- `{scope-id}` is the folder path specified on the export.
  > Hubs 0.3 and earlier use this to identify which scope the data is coming from. We recommend using the scope ID but any value can be used. Example scope IDs include:
  >
  > | Scope type      | Example value                                                          |
  > | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  > | Subscription    | `/subscriptions/###`                                                   |
  > | Resource group  | `/subscriptions/###/resourceGroups/###`                                |
  > | Billing account | `/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/###`                     |
  > | Billing profile | `/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/###/billingProfiles/###` |
  >
- `{export-name}` is the name of the export.
  > Hubs ignore this folder.
- `{date-range}` is the date range data being exported.
  > Hubs 0.3 and earlier use this to identify the month. Format for this folder is `yyyyMMdd-yyyyMMdd`. Hubs 0.4 uses the manifest instead.
- `{export-time}` is a timestamp of when the export ran.
  > Hubs ignore this. Format for this folder is `yyyyMMddHHmm`.
- `{guid}` is a unique GUID and isn't always present.
  > Hubs ignore this. Cost Management does not always include this folder. Whether or not it is included depends on the API version used to create the export.
- `{file}` is either a manifest or exported data.
  > Version 0.3 and earlier ignore manifest files and only monitor **\*.csv** files. In a future release, hubs will monitor the manifest.

<br>

## FinOps hubs v0.1

The following steps outline the process for exporting and processing cost data using FinOps hubs version 0.1:

1. Cost Management exports raw cost details to the **msexports** container.
2. The **msexports_transform** pipeline saves the raw data in parquet format to the **ingestion** container.
3. Power BI reads cost data from the **ingestion** container.
