# FinOps hub template

This document provides a detailed summary of what's included in the FinOps hubs deployment template. You can use this as a guide for tuning your deployment or to inform customizations you can make to the template to meet your organizational needs. This document explains the required prerequisites to deploy the template, input parameters you can customize, resources that will be deployed, and the template outputs. Template outputs can be used to connect to your hub instances in Power BI, Data Explorer, or other tools.

FinOps hubs includes many resources to offer a secure and scalable FinOps platform. The main resources you will interact with include:

- Data Explorer (Kusto) as a scalable datastore for advanced analytics (optional).
- Storage account (Data Lake Storage Gen2) as a staging area for data ingestion.
- Data Factory instance to manage data ingestion and cleanup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use the template, you need to create Cost Management exports to publish data to the `msexports` container in the included storage account. For more information, see [Create a new hub](finops-hubs-overview.md#create-a-new-hub).

   _¹ It's sufficient to assign hubs resources deployment permissions on the resource group scope._<br/>
   _² Cost Management permissions must be assigned on the scope where you want to export your costs from._<br/>
   _³ Blob data permissions are required to access exported cost data from Power BI or other client tools._<br/>

- The Microsoft.EventGrid resource provider must be registered in your subscription. For more information, see [Register a resource provider](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#register-resource-provider).

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If you forget this step, the deployment will succeed, but the pipeline trigger will not be started and data will not be ready. For more information, see [Troubleshooting Power BI reports](../help/troubleshooting.md).

## Resources

The following resources are created in the target resource group during deployment.

Resources use the following naming convention: `<hubName>-<purpose>-<unique-suffix>`. Names are adjusted to account for length and character restrictions. The `<unique-suffix>` is used to ensure resource names are globally unique where required.

- `<hubName>store<unique-suffix>` storage account (Data Lake Storage Gen2)
  - Blob containers:
    - `msexports` – Temporarily stores Cost Management exports.
    - `ingestion` – Stores ingested data.
      > [!NOTE]
      > In the future, we will use this container to stage external data outside of Cost Management.
          - `config` – Stores hub metadata and configuration settings. Files:
      - `settings.json` – Hub settings.

    - `config_RunExportJobs` – Runs the specified Cost Management exports.
    - `msexports_ExecuteETL` – Queues the `msexports_ETL_ingestion` pipeline to account for Data Factory pipeline trigger limits.
    - `msexports_ETL_ingestion` – Converts Cost Management exports into parquet and removes historical data duplicated in each day's export.
    - `ingestion_ExecuteETL` – Queues the `ingestion_ETL_dataExplorer` pipeline to account for Data Factory pipeline trigger limits.
    - `ingestion_ETL_dataExplorer` – Ingests parquet data into an Azure Data Explorer cluster.
  - Triggers:
    - `config_SettingsUpdated` – Triggers the `config_ConfigureExports` pipeline when settings.json is updated.
    - `config_DailySchedule` – Triggers the `config_RunExportJobs` pipeline daily for the current month's cost data.
    - `config_MonthlySchedule` – Triggers the `config_RunExportJobs` pipeline monthly for the previous month's cost data.

  - `Hub` database – Public-facing functions to abstract internals.
    - Includes 2 sets of functions:
      - Dataset-specific functions for the latest supported FOCUS version (for example, `Costs`, `Prices`).
      - Dataset-specific functions for each supported FOCUS version (for example, `Costs_v1_0` for FOCUS 1.0). These functions are provided for backwards compatibility. All functions return all data aligned to the targeted FOCUS version.
    - Datasets include: `Costs`, `Prices`.
    - Supported FOCUS versions include: `v1_0`.
  - `Ingestion` database – Stores ingested data.
    - Settings:
      - `HubSettingsLog` table – Stores a history of high-level configuration changes (for example, versions, scopes).
      - `HubSettings` function – Gets the latest version of the hub instance settings.
      - `HubScopes` function – Gets the currently configured scopes for this hub instance.
    - Open data:
      - `PricingUnits` table – [PricingUnits mapping file](../open-data.md#pricing-units) from the FinOps toolkit. Used for data normalization and cleanup.
      - `Regions` table – [Regions mapping file](../open-data.md#regions) from the FinOps toolkit. Used for data normalization and cleanup.
      - `ResourceTypes` table – [ResourceTypes mapping file](../open-data.md#resource-types) from the FinOps toolkit. Used for data normalization and cleanup.
      - `Services` table – [Services mapping file](../open-data.md#services) from the FinOps toolkit. Used for data normalization and cleanup.
      - `resource_type` function – Simple function to map internal resource type IDs to display names based on the [ResourceTypes mapping file](../open-data.md#resource-types).
        - Use this function to map a single values and join with the `ResourceTypes` table to update many rows or map other values.
    - Datasets:
      - `<dataset>_raw` table – Raw data directly from the ingestion source. Uses a union schema for data from multiple sources.
      - `<dataset>_transform_vX_Y` function – Normalizes and cleans raw data to align to the targeted FOCUS version using open data tables as needed.
      - `<dataset>_final_vX_Y` table – Clean version of the corresponding raw table aligned to the targeted FOCUS version. Populated via an update policy that uses the corresponding transform function when data is ingested into raw tables.

In addition to the preceding information, the following resources are created to automate the deployment process. The deployment scripts should be deleted automatically. However, don't delete the managed identities as it might cause errors when upgrading to the next release.

<!-- cSpell:ignore datafactory -->

- Managed identities:
  - `<storage>_blobManager` ([Storage Blob Data Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#storage-blob-data-contributor)) – Uploads the settings.json file.
  - `<datafactory>_triggerManager` ([Data Factory Contributor](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#data-factory-contributor)) – Stops triggers before deployment and starts them after deployment.
- Deployment scripts (automatically deleted after a successful deployment):
  - `<datafactory>_deleteOldResources` – Deletes unused resources from previous FinOps hubs deployments.
  - `<datafactory>_stopTriggers` – Stops all triggers in the hub using the triggerManager identity.
  - `<datafactory>_startTriggers` – Starts all triggers in the hub using the triggerManager identity.
  - `<storage>_uploadSettings` – Uploads the settings.json file using the blobManager identity.
