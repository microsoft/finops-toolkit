| `SkuPriceId` doesn't identify a single price and doesn't have an equivalent in the price sheet.                        | For EA accounts, join with the price sheet using `x_SkuMeterId`/`MeterId`, `x_SkuOfferId`/`OfferID`, `x_SkuTerm`/`Term`, and `CommitmentDiscountType`/`PriceType`. For MCA accounts, join with the price sheet using `SkuPriceId` and a concatenated "{ProductId}_{SkuId}_{MeterId}" string, `x_SkuTerm`/`Term`, and `CommitmentDiscountType`/`PriceType`. Note MCA accounts also require the tier, which isn't currently available in any cost details dataset. | SkuPriceId<br>SkPI4                             |
| `CommitmentDiscountId` doesn't match `ResourceId` exactly because ResourceId is lowercased to meet FOCUS requirements. | Convert `CommitmentDiscountId` to lowercase if comparing to ResourceId.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | CommitmentDiscountId, ResourceId<br>DH3.12, SH2 |
