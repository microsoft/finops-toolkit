# Validate FOCUS data

This document helps you validate FOCUS data by comparing it to actual and amortized cost data from Cost Management. The goal of this article is to help you familiarize yourself with and transition to FOCUS data with confidence. To learn more about FOCUS, refer to the [FOCUS overview](what-is-focus.md).

The comparisons in this document are focused on costs, prices, and quantities to facilitate validating numbers across datasets. For details about text and dates, refer to [Updating reports to use FOCUS columns](mapping.md).

FOCUS includes both actual and amortized data in a single dataset. So, there are more rows in FOCUS than you find in either the actual or amortized cost datasets. However, there are fewer records than actual and amortized datasets together since many records are duplicated across actual and amortized datasets.

## Compare FOCUS with actual cost

The following mapping can be used to compare FOCUS with an actual cost data in Cost analysis or other cost API or export.

| Actual cost column                                                                                      | FOCUS column                                                                    | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
