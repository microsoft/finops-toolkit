# FOCUS conformance full report

This document provides a detailed list of all FOCUS 1.0 requirements and indicates the level of support provided by the Microsoft Cost Management FOCUS dataset. To learn more about FOCUS, refer to the [FOCUS overview](./what-is-focus.md).

<br>

## How conformance is measured

FOCUS requirements fall into four groups:

- **MUST** requirements are mandatory for all data providers.
- **SHOULD** requirements are strong recommendations.
- **RECOMMENDED** requirements are suggested best practices.
- **MAY** requirements are optional and used to prepare FinOps practitioners for edge cases.

While there's no official measurement for FOCUS conformance, we calculate a conformance score of **96%**, which accounts for all fully and partially supported requirements. The following table summarizes requirements by level of support.

| Type            | Supported | Partial support | Not supported | Not applicable |
| :-------------- | :-------: | :-------------: | :-----------: | :------------: |
| **MUST**        |    238    |       13        |       2       |       10       |
| **SHOULD**      |    22     |        3        |       1       |       1        |
| **RECOMMENDED** |     0     |        1        |       1       |       0        |
| **MAY**         |    22     |        0        |       0       |       1        |
| Summary         |   93.1%   |      5.6%       |     1.3%      |                |

## How this document is organized

The following sections list each FOCUS requirement, the level of support in the Microsoft Cost Management FOCUS 1.0 dataset, and any relevant notes. For a high-level summary of the gaps, refer to the [FOCUS conformance summary](./conformance-summary.md). Requirement IDs are for reference purposes only. IDs aren't defined as part of FOCUS.

The rest of this document lists the FOCUS requirements grouped by attribute and column. [Columns](#columns) define the specific data elements in the dataset and [attributes](#attributes) define how columns and rows should behave. High-level descriptions and a link to the original requirements document are included at the top of each section.

Both columns are documented in a pending FOCUS pull request. Non-prefixed column names are maintained for backwards compatibility until an official determination is made about them. |
